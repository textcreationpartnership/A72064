         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Haue heard of a diſcourſe the other yeare, betweene two Frenchmen, the one a Souldier, the other a Ciuilian, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vices of their times, and country. The Souldier was the Duke de <hi>Mercury,</hi> a right noble, and vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Captaine, late Lieftenant gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to the Emperour, againſt the Turk in Hungarie, and yet a great enemy to Duells. The Ciuilian was a Companion of his, and vndertooke againſt <hi>coueting,</hi> as it appeares by the Preamble following. And I am ſorie wee haue no more of theirs, but the Preamble; ſince the times, and vices be as well ours as theirs. What the reſt of their method was, J haue not ſeene, but by the qualitie of their perſons, &amp; by their learning we may imagine. The argument could not be but profitable, and J ſet downe, what I thinke probable to come neereſt their meaning, and the good of our nation; and I ſpeake Engliſh to Engliſh. For heere is firſt ſet vp the marke, or white, which wee muſt all ſhoote at, and is done in two Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Paranaeticall</hi> to heauen-ward, The one ſhewing vs our way thither, The other our happines, when we come there. Here are ſecondly diſcouered two potent impediments in our way, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſight, and leuell: and theſe are our <hi>Iraſcible,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcible</hi> parts. The abuſe whereof is touched in two <hi>Charges;</hi> the one ſhewing the iniuſtice of <hi>Duell:</hi> the other our common iniuſtice in buying, and ſelling, and neglect of common good. And laſtly, here be two <hi>Homages,</hi> or <hi>thankſ-giuings</hi> to God.
<pb facs="tcp:150605:3"/>The one of a Soule truely conuerted, the other of one proceeding in his grace, with ſignes of both. There be many things here delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be thought of, nothing hard to be done, and wee ſhall blame our ſelues moſt deſperately, if we haue not done. Read there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeech thee, and make vſe of It; which if thou doe, thou wilt finde much comfort; and if all doe, they will make as flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing a common-wealth as euer was. There will ſcarce be any poore in it, or any vnquietnes. Kings will glorie in their Subiects, and Subiects in their Soueraigne, and all in each other, as it is in Heauen.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the ceaſing of our Turkiſh warres and twenty yeares peace concluded with <hi>Acmath</hi> king of Turkie 1608. our faces were all turned homeward, and my volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not a few were impatient of idleneſſe, ſeeking to bee diſmiſſed for ſome other imployment. They had followed mee indeede many hundred miles out of France; for which I was not onely willing to liſten to them, but alſo ready to gratifie them in ſome ſort, with a finall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of my loue vpon our parting. I ſent therefore for my Chaplaine to come to mee <hi>Mounſieur Iohn Faber</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenciat in Diuinity, to be aduiſed by him: who as hee was a man both learned, and diſcreete; ſo could hee beſt ſatisfie me in any thing I ſhould deſire. And when hee was come, none being with me then, but <hi>Mr. Doctor Petroneus</hi> my aſſiſtant, a Ciuilian of great vnderſtanding, and <hi>Lancelot Mott</hi> my Comptroller, ſecond of my Councell; Sir ſaid I to my Chaplaine, wee haue a reſolution to diſcharge our companies, and to licence our voluntaries, which you know are many in this towne of <hi>Vienna:</hi> for we looſe but time in theſe parts, our buſines being now at an end. We came not hither to chaſe the Stagge or wilde Boare, and nothing elſe you ſee is heere to bee done. A great many of them came freely to vs, and I would ſend them away with honour: howbeit, while I bethinke mee of our departure hence, and of our long ſeparation that will bee, hauing beene hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo long accuſtomed together; I remember the ſaying of Chriſt, and I am touched with ſome part of his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150605:4"/>ſaying, <hi>miſereor ſuper turbam,</hi> &amp; ſo ſay I in my affection towards them,
<note place="margin">Mark. 8.</note> that I haue pitie ouer my company: and as Chriſthereupon did feed their bodies miraculouſly; ſo theſe that haue no corporall need, I would they were ſpiritually fed before their going; that aboue all things in theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times they may not faint in their way to heauen, &amp; may be profitable in their countries where they are to goe. They are to me as children, &amp; I know we ſhal not part aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without teares on both ſides. I would haue them to doe well, &amp; ſome inſtructions I wiſh they had with them, ſuch as your ſelfe thinkes beſt. Both is your authority among them ſuch as they will eaſily beleeue you; and your learning and Methode ſuch, as they will delight to heare you, and beare it in mind. I haue beene often bold with you, as my inward friend, yet neuer ſo bold as to giue you your text. Neither will, onely thus much, I would entreate you againſt the feaſt following, which is now at hand, that ye will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay ſomewhat againſt the enormities of our countrey by <hi>anger,</hi> and <hi>auatice.</hi> The one proper to men of warre, the other to men of peace: yet both to much vſed by both, and haue made our Country ill ſpoken of, and diſioyned many families with ciuill diſſention. I am well aduiſed what I ſpeake. There be in this citty diuers that may doe much in their countrey by their good example, and I doubt not will come to ſuch preferment there, as may amend many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are much amiſſe. Our ſingle challenge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats there, are growne ſo common, and vpon ſo ſlight oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, fiue thouſand haue bene ſlaine vpon it in France a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone within theſe twenty yeares, and ſo many pardons of record to be ſeene for it at this day: and againe, our grating is ſo extreame vpon the poorer ſort, that I know not what will come of it in the end, but the ruine of vs all. The commons will be glad of the leaſt quarrell againſt the rich, and daily factions betweene families will lay vs open to any potent enemy to doe vs wrong. But what ſhould I ſpeake thus to you, who know it as well as I. There bee thoſe that come to ſee vs euery day, right worthy perſons, and great friends; but when they come home, they will bee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150605:4"/>enemies I feare me; if they haue not ſome warning, and be not ſtored with the greater grace. Of the two vices I ſpeak of, I know not which is the cauſe of moſt iniuſtice: well I am aſſured, none doth iuſtice in the heate of anger, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueting, more angry ſometimes for a ſmall matter then a great; will kill a man for ſpeaking of a word amiſſe, and will ſpare a man that pickes his purſe; will not ſpend three pence vpon a poore body, and will haue hundreds inſtore to circumuent a poore gentleman. All the world is miſled with theſe two vices, and were it not for theſe two, there would neede no Officers in a kingdome. I know no ſinne almoſt, but one of theſe is, I will not ſay the cauſer, but the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcer of it. Giue them I pray ſome effectuall warning of theſe, that their corporall fight may ſo match with their ſpirituall, as they may not periſh for want of inſtruction. Wherunto my Chaplaine: Sir ſaid he, your excellencie hath propounded very well, and your zeale no doubt proceedeth from heauenly grace. I ſhall not be wanting on my part to doe God and you ſeruice, and the fruites of your deſire ſhall be the performance of my vttermoſt. But by your graces fauour, ſince it hath pleaſed you to participate thus much of your minde vnto me, which belongeth ſpecially to my charge to be anſwerable vnto, yea forwarder to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh ſo pious a requeſt, then you to propoſe: you haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me bouldnes in this, to impart vnto you alſo my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what I thinke beſt, and will be moſt fruitfull, if it ſhall pleaſe you to conceiue ſo. I will prepare my ſelfe (God willing) againſt your day, though it coſt me two daies in reſpect of my weaknes; not hauing yet recouered perfectly the blowe of a Halbard, that beat my Target to my head, and one of my ſides to the ground, which ſo impaired my ſtrength, that I cannot ſpeake much at a time. By Gods grace I ſhall ſet them in a ready way to heauen: but forme to diſcourſe of <hi>Duellum;</hi> where occaſion will be to ſpeake of honour, and armes, it little belongeth to my profeſsion, but more a great deale to men of honour, and approued valour, ſuch as you are. For although where men make conſcience of any thing, and reſort to me in priuate for my opinion, I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150605:5"/>ſhall be furniſhed I hope to reſolue them: yet will it be little eſteemed from one of our ſort, to ſpeake all that ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will require. They that contemne Chriſt in ſuch a buſines, will ſooner contemne his ſeruants. Wee that be Cleargie men are accompted cowards, and daſtards, as I heard a knight ſay once of a Biſhop who had beene his Lord, and Maſter: he commended him for his vertues, and wiſedome; ſaue only that he was a Coward, for putting vp ſo eaſily a boxe on the eare from a Duke, and following his maſters ſteppes the Sauiour of the world. Truth is truth out of any mans mouth, and yet more aptly deliuered by one, then by another. When we perſwade in ſuch a matter, they tell vs we be <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and ſpeake like our ſelues, and are very ſimply conceited of vs whatſoeuer we ſay; yea when they be driuen to ſay with vs, they thinke againſt vs, and doe what they liſt, <hi>Maius peccatum habent.</hi> I ſpeake not this to flye the burthen of telling truth, whether it edifie or not: at their perill be it, if they receiue not the ſeede that is ſowne in their hearts. But Sir, it would beſt become your ſelfe ſuch a burthen as this, who are both a <hi>Souldier</hi> and a <hi>Scholler:</hi> we were both brought vp at a time, and ſtudents in the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.</hi> The eies of all men were vpon you euen then, to ſee honour and learning ſo vnmatchable in your perſon; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnderſtander of that you heard and read, and a perfect deliuerer of that you vnderſtood. You were but young, when you had paſſed your courſes of Philoſophie, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie: and when your ripenes was readie for the harueſt, our common-wealth, had the reaping of your beſt fruites in the greateſt imployments both at home, and abroade. Thinke it not much to heare a little of your praiſe. I haue done before I haue begun. I haue heard you ſpeake very well at your board of many points concerning this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie. I know none can ſpeake better then your ſelfe of it, if it would pleaſe you to appoint a time, and to beſtowe an houre or two that way: with this, my Comptroler applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it exceedingly, and though your Chaplin, ſaid he, might doe it very well, and can doe much in that company to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, yet none more fit then your ſelfe, a Chriſtian Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150605:5"/>amongſt Chriſtian Souldiers and much more piercing it would be in their hearts, to heare ſo noble a ſword-man to ſpeake againſt the ſword, or <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe to ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt combate, whoſe honour is in fight: well ſaid I, ye will perſwade me anon to preach too: I will be aduiſed. But what ſay you to the other matter, which was <hi>Auarice:</hi> that, I hope you will ſpeake of. No truely Sir ſaid my Chaplaine, if it pleaſe Mr. Aſsiſtant to vndergoe that charge: who is both learned in our lawes, and of great eſtate himſelfe, and and euery way fitteſt, except his trouble. Not I Sir (truely ſaid he.) I thought as much, this is not the firſt time you haue glanced at mee: they be matters of conſcience, and conſequence, that muſt bee handled therein; and are fitteſt for your charge. I pray do you your duty as my Lord hath mooued, and let me heare no more of this: I am no Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. Yee ſhall both command mee, (ſaid my Chaplaine) and I will not faile of my duty, if ye will haue it ſo: I doe but propound what I know, and am well aſſured would be beſt. The ſinne of <hi>Auarice</hi> ye ſpeake of, is crept ſo farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cleargie, that our hearers bidde vs amend our ſelues firſt, before wee preach amendment to others; and they giue vs a very deafe eare, whatſoeuer wee tell them vpon this Theame. To be a Preacher belongs not to your voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> yet euery one ought to bee a Preacher if God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty bidde ſpeake: yea to ſhunne this charge when it may do good, is to bluſh at the Goſpell. And who can ſpeake more freely of this then you, who are furniſhed with all that nature and art can affoord? who of your ſort better ſeene in Scripture or hiſtory then you? who better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Common Law, or Ciuill then you, hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes profeſſed the one of them to your great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? who more nobly diſcended for a gentleman, better ſtated for land and offices, or that hath a more worthy off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring to prouide for then you? and if it were lawfull in any to be couetous, it were truely lawfull in you; that haue ſo great a charge to care for, and feede ſo many mouthes: pretence of neede, or feare of neede, makes many couetous, and there is a kinde of neede that attends the greateſt. And
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150605:6"/>therefore for a man of your qualitie not to bee couetous, who hath no end of expences; or to ſpeake againſt coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, which is want to maintaine greatneſſe; would be as rare to heare, as imitable for example. The world wants many ſuch as you, that can as well ſpeake as doe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe Robes and Veluet gowne will not become a Pulpit, yet fit enough if it pleaſe my Lord for a great cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. There bee many that giue the charge at a Seſsions, not better furniſhed then you for the peoples edifying: and it is no more but a charge that is required of you, although it bee in matters of much greater importance, and that touch more neerely the inward reformation: neither ſpeake I this to eaſe me of a burthen (as I ſaid before) who am born for burthens:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 65.</note> for as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, God hath laide his people vpon our necks; and yet if ſuch a one as you can doe more with a word, then wee with ten, (pardon mee Sir I beſeech you) I know not how you will bee excuſed. But I ſay no more, your will ſhall be done. Well Sir ſaide my Aſsiſtant, ſince you bee in good earneſt, you ſhall not take offence at me: but what if I deceiue your expectation, and ſhall not performe ſo well, as the matter importeth. Surely Sir, ſaide my Comptroler, that was not wont to bee your fault; and for my owne part, I muſt ſay what I thinke: I had rather heare but halfe from my Lord and you, concerning theſe matters, then the whole matter from another: for both in the one caſe, my Lord being a man of Sword and honour, it is not like but hee will reſpect what hee may the honour of gentlemen vpon falling out: ſo on the other ſide, your ſelfe beeing alſo noble, and of great expence, who muſt haue much comming in to beare your charge; there is none will feare, or doubt partiality in you, to ſpeake againſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueting or keeping, more then you muſt needes: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will extend your ſelfe as farre as you may, and your learning will giue leaue. Spirituall men ſpeake learnedly of their matters, and whatſoeuer yee bring vs, I ſuppoſe yee fetch it from their groundes: but if the temporall alſo, and men of action concurre with the ſame, as I know not well yet whether they doe or no; and I would gladly learne:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150605:6"/>ſurely this will make a double barre againſt all impugners, that the euill diſpoſed will not haue a word to ſay, wee haue a gheſſe ſufficient what our Prelates will ſay. But ſince the motion hath beene made, and to my ſeeming very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: I ſhould bee a petitioner to you both, and many more yee ſhall haue if neede bee, that it may bee ſo. Wee are true <hi>Jſraelites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 20.19</note> that had rather heare <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeake then God almighty: whereat, when wee had laughed a little while; It is not vnuſuall with mee ſaid I, to ſpeake to my fellowes and followers; and yet it is more then I dare promiſe you, neither will, vnleſſe my Aſsiſtant doe as much: I will take a pawſing time, and if I can thinke of any thing worth your hearing, you ſhall know: and my Aſsiſtant vndertooke in like manner. And ſo beeing ready to depart, I tolde them that for teaching I would not intermeddle, but leaue them wholly to their Paſtours; whom I would exhort what I could, to beleeue and follow in all ſuch matters as I ſhould giue them in charge; and but a charge I would make of it. No more ſhall I (ſaid my Aſsiſtant.) And my charge my Lord (ſaid my Comptroler) ſhall be to put your Excellency to charge for the time, and to bidde them all welcome with the beſt cheere wee can make them. This was the end of our Parlance, and when the times came, we performed accordingly: whereof I haue heere ſet downe the dead letters; but whoſoeuer had heard my Chaplaine, would haue loued the world the worſe as long as they liued. My Aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant likewiſe deliuered it with much grace, and grauity: and my ſelfe did my good will. My Chaplaine began as followeth.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honourable, worſhipfull, and well beloued, yee are come hither (I perceiue) to heare ſomewhat for your edification: but I feare mee, you ſhall finde a ſouldier of mee, rather then a diuine: for ſo my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years employment in the campe hath made me; beeing a place of all others vnfit for ſtudy, and a mortall enemy to Muſes. My ſcarres ye ſee make mention of ſome wounds, and my blood hath teſtified my loue to you, that haue ſeldome failed to beare you company in your thickeſt perills, with target in one hand, and my booke in the other. I haue aſsiſted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a gaſping ſpirit in their <hi>agony to heauen-ward;</hi> where I doubt not now, but they ſee, and ſit with God for euer and euer: and you, whom his heauenly prouidence hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from ſlaughter, hee hath preſerued (ye muſt thinke) for his further ſeruice: if your ſword ruſt, yet your action may not, which muſt euermore bee doing, and working of your weale: ye haue peace now, and ye haue put vp your wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; what then? peace giues reſt to temporall, and not to ſpirituall fight, we may neuer ſtand ſtill in our way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: and thither I was wiſhed to exhort you to day by one, whoſe authority I may in no wiſe decline.

                  </bibl>
               </q>
               <p>Intending therefore to exhort you, or rather to haſten you in your way to heauen: I thought it fitte to lay before you the ſaying of <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet. <hi>Why ſpend ye ſiluer</hi> (ſaith he) and not in breads? your labour and not in ſaturity? A ſhort ſpeach, but full of miſtery: why ſpend yee ſiluer and not in bread, your labour and not in ſaturity or fulneſſe? we will ſpeake firſt of the firſt part, and afterwards of the ſecond: &amp; as touching the firſt part, it is well enough known there is nothing more needful for the ſuſtentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bread. It is that we pray for in our <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> as the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt foode, and moſt vniuerſall that is: kings themſelues cannot be without it; and the pooreſt haue it, though they haue nothing elſe: euery body loueth it; no one diſh, that euery body loueth; yet euery one loues bread. And beſides the loue we all haue to it, God hath giuen it this preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, that, as it is moſt neceſſary, ſo is it beſt cheape, and eaſieſt to come by. And therefore moſt iuſtly the Prophet cries out, ſaying; why ſpend yee ſiluer and not in bread? as who ſhould ſay; why ſpend ye money vpon trifles, your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony vpon paſtimes, and all the meanes you haue vpon merriments, and are content to ſit a hungred for them?</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:150605:8"/>
               <p> But what I pray you is this ſiluer, that men ſpend in this idle ſort? all that a man hath or can poſſeſſe in this world, may be drawne to two heads: the one is time, which how precious it is I neede not tell, but if it were ten times more, it were all too little to ſpend in our way to heauen. The other is our goods (that is to ſay) all we haue; whether they be of minde, as reaſon, witte, will, memory, learning, and ſuch like; or of body, health, ſtrength, actiuity, prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe, eloquence, or of outward fortunes, as riches, honour, pleaſures, and the like; all which is heere called <hi>Siluer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 21.</note> as in heauen all is gold. And this is the ſiluer the holy Prophet ſpeaketh of, when he asketh vs this queſtion after a manner of increpation, or in chiding ſort, ſaying: why ſpend yee all theſe things and not in bread?</p>
               <p>But holy Prophet of God, ſhall I aske thee a queſtion? didſt thou euer know any that ſpent much, and cared not how much, and that much of it was not in bread? could hee liue without eating? did he not feaſt and make merry? and could this be done without bread? which if thou canſt not deny; why doeſt thou ſay they ſpend, and not in bread? I acknowledge thee Gods Prophet, and vpon this infallible word by thee deliuered I muſt build to day: thy thought muſt bee my theame, thy ſpirit my text as neere as I can. <hi>Bread</hi> was therefore heere but an allegory, or figuratiue ſpeech, and by it is meant the bread of life, or bread of the ſoule; as appeareth by that which followeth tending all to the ſoule, and not to the body, where hee ſaith ſoone after, <hi>Hearing, heare me, and eate that is good,</hi> and yourſoule, hee ſaith, not your body ſhall bee delighted with fatneſſe. And againe; <hi>giue eare, and come to me, heare me, and your ſoule</hi> (he ſaith not your body) ſhall liue, and I will make an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting league with you. The bread of the ſoule therefore is the bread hee ſpeakes of, and this onely bread is intended heere; the bread that nouriſheth vs, the bread that ſtrengtheneth vs; is not to ſinne, and perdition, but to heauen and happineſſe. This is the bread I ſay the prophet ſpeaketh of, and no man cares for; lets it lye moulding by him, and buyeth it not; is daily offered him, and hee daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150605:9"/>it; yea ſcornes the offerer or bringer of it for the moſt part.</p>
               <p>But let vs enter a little further into the matter I beſeech you, to find what this bread is, that wee may buy thereof, ſince it ſeemeth ſo neceſſary. Truely it is not hard to finde, if we would but contemplate our neede: if our bodies were hungrie, wee ſhould know how to ſeeke, and where to buy: we forget not our dinner or ſupper, though ſtomacke we haue none; the time of the day will remember vs of it: and ſhall not our vpriſing then, and downe lying put vs in mind of our ſoules food for our ſpirituall good, and life euerlaſting? Let vs ſtirre vp our zeale a little, and marke what this bread is, and what the worth of it. <hi>Open</hi> your hands and vnfolde your armes; that yee may bee ready to catch it, and hold it when you haue it.</p>
               <p>This breads right worthy, is in two kinds anſwerable to our eſtates or liues in this world, and the world to come. And therefore he calleth it breads, not bread: the one ſort of bread for diſtinctions ſake, I call the bread of trauellers, <hi>Panem viatorum:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 77.</note> the other <hi>Panem angelorum,</hi> the bread of Angels: which latter name, although it bee applied ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the firſt ſence, yet in this place for my better me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thood, and your better remembrance, I will diſtinguiſh from the other; and confine it onely to our eſtate in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and to our food there. The firſt bread is that our ſoules doe feede on, while it is in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ia</hi> in the way to heauen. And therefore I call it <hi>Panem viatorum;</hi> as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> cals our life heere <hi>Figuram viatorum:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hom. 60. in Math. Pſal. 101.24.</note> The other is that it feeds on in the end of the way, when it comes to heauen, and muſt liue for euer. Of this laſt I ſhall ſpeake laſt in time conuenient; of the firſt I ſhall ſpeake firſt, and ſhall reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it to the <hi>Shew bread,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Reg. 21.</note> or bread of <hi>Propoſition,</hi> that was giuen to <hi>Dauid</hi> to eate of, when he had beene weary and hungry, and was purſued by his enemies: and it was ſuch as he might not eate, but with cleanneſſe of body, as the Scripture declareth.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderſtanding whereof, and true applying it to our ſelues, we muſt know alſo that three ſpeciall things
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150605:9"/>are comprehended in this bread of trauellers: the one is the word of God. The ſecond all manner of vertues, and good habits in our ſoules. The third is Sacraments; all which may rightly bee called bread, and ſo ſometimes are in holy Scripture. The word of God is called by <hi>Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Mat. 15.16.</note> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis filiorum</hi> the bread of children. And the woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> calleth it the crummes that fell from the maſters ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertues</hi> bee alſo called bread: ſorrowes and teares for ſinne is a great vertue. And holy <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth it bread: my teares haue beene bread to me day and night; and in an other place, <hi>thou ſhalt feede vs with bread of teares.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 41. Pſal. 79.</note> An other vertue like to this is true mortification or pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which is ſignified in Scripture by this word <hi>Aſhes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 101.</note> As king <hi>Dauid</hi> vſeth it ſaying, that he eate aſhes for his bread; as who ſhould ſay, that aſhes were bread to him: All which things and whatſoeuer elſe that comforts our ſoule, he may ſeeme to call by the name of bread, when hee imputes his drineſſe of ſpirit to nothing elſe, but to the neglect of it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I was withered like hay, and my heart was dryed vp, <hi>Quia oblitus ſum comedere panem meum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 101.</note> Becauſe I forgat to eate my bread.</p>
               <p>Laſtly For Sacraments, <hi>Omnia Sacramenta</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>) All Sacraments that are done in vs by the miniſtery of Gods ſeruants, are meate to our bellie. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> calleth his ſupper by the name of <hi>Bread:</hi> ſaying,
<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that eateth this bread ſhall liue for euer,</hi> and preferreth it before <hi>Moſes</hi> his bread, ſaying, that <hi>Moſes</hi> gaue not bread from heauen, but my Father (ſaith he) giues you true bread from heauen. Note this word <hi>true bread:</hi> as who ſhould ſay this were not true bread which wee eate with our meate; but rather a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue bread, feeding onely the fleſh: and the Sacrament the true bread that feedeth and ſuſtaineth the ſoule, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part of man. And theſe three breads may well bee meant by thoſe three loaues in the Goſpell,
<note place="margin">Luk. 11.</note> which one came to borrow of his friend at midnight, and was importunate for. Whereupon Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> asketh this queſtion,
<note place="margin">lib. 7. in Luc.</note> and makes anſwer, <hi>Qui ſunt isti tres panes</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>niſi coeleſtis misterij alimentum,</hi> What bee theſe three loaues, but the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150605:10"/>foode of heauenly miſteries.
<note place="margin">Hom. 26. in Ioh.</note> 
                  <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> alſo calles theſe heauenly things bread, and telles vs the ſweetneſſe of it, ſuch as is able to intice and force a mans heart to the loue of it, how little ſoeuer the world doth eſteeme it. But to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>All theſe three may bee rightly called the bread of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as I ſaide; beeing ſhewne and propounded for all to buy of, and feede on, that bee yet as <hi>Trauellers</hi> before they come to their iournies ende. <hi>The word of God</hi> feedes vs with inſtruction: <hi>Vertues</hi> feede vs with imitation: <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> feede vs with grace and conſolation. The word of God giues life, and motion to our ſoules: <hi>Vertues</hi> digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and <hi>Sacraments</hi> augmentation. The word of God with what reuerence it muſt bee handled: <hi>Vertues</hi> with what reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution they muſt bee imbraced: a <hi>Sacrament</hi> with what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie it muſt bee receiued. I vndertake not now to teach: yee know or may know by your learned <hi>Prelates,</hi> to whom I remit you: onely of vertues I ſay thus much to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are more within the compaſſe of your vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and yee haue daily vſe of them; that as they be many and very nouriſhing to your ſoules; ſo are they like flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in your garden, oyle in your lampes, and corne to your Mill. A Mill will bee fired, and the ſtones fret out one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without corne in it: euen ſo doe our paſsions, they chafe vs and fret vs to nothing, if <hi>Vertues</hi> come not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene. The flowers of vertue refreſh and comfort the ſoule, and make it admirably ſweete. The oyle of vertue makes the ſoule ſo bright and ſmoothe, that God may ſee his owne face in it, and acknowledge vs thereby to bee his true Image.</p>
               <p>In particular haue wee taken away ones good name, or any thing elſe that is his? Let vs make a vertue of it by ſubmiſsion, and reſtitution. Are we angry at a diſgrace done vs? Let vs not bee haſty of reuenge; but let vs bee glad if wee can, of ſuch a tryall ſent vs. Temperance of body, and chaſtity of minde, are great vertues and indeere vs to God. I may not omit humility and mildeneſſe, gentleneſſe and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability,
<note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> that makes vs the very childe that God tooke vp
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150605:10"/>in his armes, and ſhewed him for a patterne for all the world to beholde. Fortitude or valour is likewiſe a ſingular vertue, without which almoſt there can bee no vertue; not humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie nor obedience can want it, not the leaſt pasſion van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed without it: my purpoſe is not to reckon vp all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but onely to giue inſtance of a fewe. In one word, yee know all of yee when yee doe ill; ſhunne it and amend it: yee know what is vertue alſo, and when ye doe well, imbrace it and feede on it, it is your ſoules <hi>bread;</hi> and to feede on it hard, makes a fat ſoule.</p>
               <p>Theſe bee the bread you ſhould buy, theſe the things you ſhould ſpend your ſiluer on; make a houſhold booke and keepe account with your ſelues of your laying out, and expences euery day; which if they bee not in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſome of theſe vertues, or bee in a bad conſcience of the contrary; yee will grow behind hand quickly, and your ſoules will be ſo poore, that ye will rid no way in your poaſt to <hi>Heauen-ward.</hi> I haue read of a noble <hi>Romane</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sextius,</hi> who neuer miſſed night,
<note place="margin">Senec. lib. 3 de ira.</note> but would call to minde what hee had done amiſſe that day, and if any day were that he amended nothing in, he accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted it vtterly loſt: he learnt it I thinke of ſome ſeruant of God, and ſo may you looke on your compting booke euery night, and ſee what <hi>Items</hi> yee haue there, what chaſt thoughts, and how the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries reſiſted; what patience, and how anger was reſiſted; how iuſt your bargaines and contracts? how yee pray and haue God in your minde firſt and laſt? how pittifull to the poore, how heedy for ſwearing, how for curſing, how for ouermuch eating and drinking, idle talke, and ribaldry,
<note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> all which yee may doe in him that comforts you, (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) if you put your good wills to it. The horſe that carries you, muſt bee your good will: if your will bee ardent and zealous, hee neuer tyers: if it bee colde, hee holdes not out a day. The winde that launcheth you through the <hi>Ocean,</hi> muſt be your good will; the winde will bee alwaies as great as your will, and your will ſhould bee euer as great as your hunger. Oh that wee might feele our ſoules hunger as ſenſibly as our bodies hunger; wee ſhould
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150605:11"/>then buy this heauenly bread much faſter, and plye our ſoules oftner with theſe heauenly prouiſions then wee doe. <hi>Behold</hi> the woorth of this bread our holy Prophet offers vs to buy.</p>
               <p>But it may be, yee would gladly know why the Prophet calles theſe things bread, and not by ſome other name aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, that may be as ſignifying for his purpoſe as this word <hi>Bread:</hi> Surely wee ſhall finde in Scriptures if wee marke it, that what we eate to ſuſtaine our bodies with, is called ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the name of <hi>Bread,</hi> as if there were nothing elſe before vs to eate but <hi>Bread, Exod</hi> 3.2. <hi>Kings</hi> cap. 9. and other like places; where to dine or ſuppe is called to eate <hi>Bread,</hi> and yet had they other things to eate beſides bread. As wee ſee where <hi>Abraham</hi> intreated his three gueſts to come in and eate bread with him,
<note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> and yet there was not onely bread, but hony, milke, and veale. And in the firſt of <hi>Kings</hi> where <hi>Saul</hi> accurſed them that ſhould eate bread that day;
<note place="margin">cap. 14.</note> wee read what puniſhment came vpon them for <hi>Ionathans</hi> ſake, for taſting onely of a hony-combe in his way, and touched no <hi>Bread.</hi> Loe heere, where hony alſo is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by <hi>Bread,</hi> as euery thing elſe may bee which wee eate, both for the generality, and likewiſe for the neceſsity of the foode of bread; ſince euery one muſt haue it, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can bee eaten without it.</p>
               <p>All things therefore wee ſee that are foode, is called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonomaſtice</hi> by the name of <hi>Bread,</hi> as by the worthieſt name: and ſo of our ſpirituall food, if a man ſhould aske why our Prophet calleth it bread, and not by ſome other name, as why doth he not call it <hi>Clothing,</hi> ſince we cannot come there without a <hi>wedding garment:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> why doth he not call it armour or weapons <hi>arma noſtra ſpiritualia:</hi>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:150605:11"/>
               <p> All theſe things that I haue reckoned, bee they neuer ſo fitte for vs, yet are they all without vs. <hi>Cloathing</hi> is for the out-ſide, weapons, wings, ladder, almes, or whatſoeuer els, are all on the outſide of vs, and come not ſo neere our life, as bread doth: all other things doe no good without, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we haue bread within. Thoſe things indeede doe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vs, but bread doth nouriſh vs; and therefore though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things be neceſſary, yet bread is moſt neceſſary or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary of neceſſaries; and the word is vſed by the Prophet in a <hi>ſupereminent</hi> ſignification; as a man would ſay, this is locke and key, this is all in all, this the ſinewes, this the marrow of all our good: and therefore all that <hi>intrinſically</hi> ſerueth to our euerlaſting weale, bee aptly called by this word, euen this <hi>ſupereminent</hi> word <hi>Bread.</hi> And as all our outward operations, and actions are nothing without bread, and inward ſuſtentation of man; whereby he hath ſtrength, and comfort in his doing, and can doe nothing without it: So if wee ſhould deuiſe one word to call all things by, that we need, either in reſpect of the greatneſſe of our neede, or the multiplicity of them; wee can finde no one word or name ſo fitte, or ſo ſignificant as this word <hi>Bread:</hi> and for ſuch is vſed, and made choice of in our <hi>Pater noſter</hi> by God himſelfe: where whatſoeuer we neede or pray for almoſt, wee are bidden to aske it by the name of <hi>Bread,</hi> giue vs this day our daily bread: that is to ſay, as holy fathers expound it, giue vs whatſoeuer will nouriſh vs, either body, or ſoule.</p>
               <p>Are wee to pray for patience? we aske it heere by the name of <hi>Bread.</hi> Aske we ſorrow for ſinne? heere it is called bread. Aske wee feruor and deuotion? God vnderſtands vs by the name of <hi>Bread.</hi> Aske we chaſtity and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? he giues it vs heere by the word <hi>bread.</hi> Aske we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, aske wee charity, aske we grace, conſtancy, or perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the end? all is included in this word <hi>Bread.</hi> All is bread, all is foode of ſoule, all makes it fatte, rich, faire, comely and beautifull, worthy of ſaluation, worthy of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, worthy of God. And therefore no maruell if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet call theſe things <hi>Bread,</hi> ſince God ſo vnderſtands them
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150605:12"/>in our daily forme of prayer, which hee gaue vs from his bleſſed mouth: <hi>giue vs this day our daily bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let no man aske me, how is patience bread? how are deuotion, charity, or any other vertue bread? this reaſon ſhall ſerue for all reaſons, that Chriſt in effect hath called them ſo. Let vs goe buy and beſtowe our money free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on it. Let vs be profuſe, and prodigall vpon it: the more we ſpend this way, the more we haue; the more we waſt, the greater our ſtore; the more we wreſtle, and exerciſe, the leſſe weary; the faſter we runne, the more in breath, as all they that prooue ſhall aſſuredly finde. And yet, if wee ſhall ſeeke a reaſon alſo why; theſe things, or how, or in what ſence they are called <hi>bread;</hi> we ſhall not goe far for a reaſon to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them that be curious: and it will not be vnfruitfull to vs neither, when we vnderſtand it. Wee will go no further I ſay for a reaſon, then to the very nature of <hi>bread,</hi> and the properties thereof, as I will declare now vnto yee.</p>
               <p>We touched in the beginning ſome properties of <hi>bread,</hi> and ſome others there are beſides, which are alſo found in this <hi>heauenly bread:</hi> yea and much more in this, then in that. Firſt bread feeds vs and keepes vs from periſhing: ſo doth our heauenly bread feed vs and preſerue vs from periſhing eternally. I need not prooue it to you, it is well enough knowne; for as <hi>bread</hi> hath many alterations, before it come to make fleſh; euen ſo it is with our ghoſtly <hi>bread.</hi> The firſt alteration of bread is in the mouth, by eating and chewing, the mouth of the ſoule is hearing, and reading. The ſecond alteration is in the ſtomacke, where the meate is turned into a white ſubſtance called <hi>Chylus;</hi> the ſtomacke of the ſoule is deepe conſideration, all pale, and aſtoniſhed to thinke of the horrible danger it was in a little before. The third alteration is in the liuer, where our foode turnes to blood, and lookes redde; the liuer of the ſoule is ſhame, and confuſion, bluſhing redde as fire, for that wee haue done wickedly. The laſt alteration is into fleſh, and the fleſh of our ſoule, is our good eſtate to God-ward; which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and reading conſulted vpon, conſideration reſolued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhame kindled, and ſends the blood of grace from part
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150605:12"/>to part to conſolidate. Grace clarifies our reaſon, giues life to our will, blowes courage into our heart, which is the ſeat of <hi>vertues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond qualitie of bread is to make pureſt blood. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meates haue more mixture in them of choller, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy that the blood is the worſe for it, other ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſciences, and high queſtions of learning though they feede the ſoule alſo; yet are they mixed lightly with ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or emulation, as it is written, <hi>Scientia inflat;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 8,</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore goe not ſo cleerely to the good of our ſoule, as our ghoſtly food doth. This bread our Prophet ſpeakes of here, hath no ſuch mixture in it: the word of God is wholy void of it, like a chriſtall fountaine of a moſt fluent ſtreame. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> were not vertue, if it endeauoured not the ſame: and the ſacraments are the pureſt pipes from the ſide of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, and cannot make other then pureſt nouriſhment. Will ye know what blood theſe make? <hi>behold</hi> Gods Saints from <hi>Enoch</hi> to the Apoſtles, and ſo downeward: wee may know their food by their complexions that were ſo white and redde in Gods ſight according to his owne heart; the very pictures of vertue and grace: looke vpon the blood of Martyrs, how pretious it is in the ſight of God, from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> hitherto, and all ouer the world. The ſeede of man is made of the pureſt blood ſaid <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and God made choice of that blood, to ſowe the field his Church withall in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The 3. property of <hi>bread</hi> is to be loued of al: euery one loues not euery meat, yet few or none loues not bread: and ſo it is with our ſpiritual bread; euery body loues it, the very wicked loues it in a ſort, though they ſeek it not: witnes themſelues, if we aske the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But there are 2. ſorts of loue, the one fruitful, which ſinners haue not, but may haue; the other vnfruitfull, which ſinners haue, &amp; will do them no good: imperfect loue it is I grant, yet loue it is; &amp; ſo much our Sauiour may ſeem to imply, when he ſaid loue God withall thy heart:
<note place="margin">Mat, 22.37.</note> as who ſhould ſay it is loue, and they may loue God, though they loue him not withall their whole heart: <hi>Premium virtutis honor,</hi> it is vertues due to be loued, and honoured, though
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150605:13"/>it be not alwaies imbraced. Our loue to vertue is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as childrens loue to bread, or I would it were but ſo in ſome; better to be but one ſtep vp then none at all. Children will call and cry for bread, but if any thing elſe comes, they hide it, or caſt it away. But what doe I ſpeake of children, and thoſe that bee ſicke, or make ſtrange of good life? they that bee whole and ſound, or haue not loſt all feeling, muſt loue the meanes of their health, and will not refuſe it altogether; or if they doe, I holde their eſtate to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p>There is yet a fourth quality or property of <hi>bread;</hi> which is eaſineſſe to come by: and this accords alſo with our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <hi>bread.</hi> It is eaſie to bee had both in reſpect of the meanes which euery one may haue that will, as alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it ſelfe, that is euery where to be ſold: our meanes is our money, and our money (as I ſaid before) is our will, and thirſty deſire after it: God asketh no other price of vs. Let no man complaine that he hath not where withall; our good God hath prouided enough for the pooreſt that is, to buy a kingdom; though not enough alwayes to buy a cow. If the buſineſſe were a money matter, the poore could not bee vertuous, nor haue ſhare in our heauenly foode. The Goſpell tels vs that where our treaſure is,
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> there is our heart: but I thinke it is true both waies; where our mind &amp; loue is, there is our money: our loue is the beſt treaſure, and wee may furniſh our ſelues richly with it (if wee liſt) out of our owne Treaſury: Haue wee no money? let vs coyne it out of our owne hearts, and wee ſhall finde plenty. Hee that hath leaſt, hath a ſelfe to giue; and hee that hath moſt, can giue no more: and if wee would know who ſells it vs, it is God that ſells,
<note place="margin">S. Aug.</note> and God is euery where to take our price; hee is at euery occaſion, and at euery neede of ours, to take our moeny. Come occaſion of ſickneſſe, or miſchance to vs, hee is at hand to ſell vs patience. Come occaſion of miſery, or want in our poore neighbour, hee is ready to ſell vs the <hi>Bread of pitty.</hi> Come occaſion of quarrell or falling out, he proffers vs charity, ſo wee drawe our purſe wide enough. Bee wee fallen into temptation? hee tenders vs ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150605:13"/>to ouercome it. Are wee in ſinne? hee meetes vs preſently with remorſe, if wee giue him but reaſon for it. Theſe and a great deale more are the holy <hi>Bread</hi> hee giues vs at all needes, and all aſſayes, and hee meetes vs merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at our owne doore with all; wee neede not ſend ſo farre for it, as to the next market towne: and thus much for the fourth property.</p>
               <p>Now to theſe I could adde a fift; and that is ſuch a one, as a man would thinke were ill, yet is not ill, but onely with euill vſing it. There is no ſurfet ſo hurtfull to our body, as that of <hi>Bread, Omnis Saturatio mala, panis autem peſſima.</hi> If the ſtomacke bee charged with any thing elſe but bread, it will recoyle and put it vp. Bread not ſo, but lyes clumping together like lead, neither digeſting it ſelfe, nor ſuffering other thing to digeſt. And this is alſo manifeſt in our <hi>Bread</hi> of life; where pride or wearineſſe beares downe our heart, and plunges it in time into the pit of <hi>Apostacy.</hi> Begins with zeale, and ends with coldeneſſe: begins with too much, and ends with too little: begins hotly, and hath not grace to holde out. Was <hi>incraſſatus, &amp; dilectus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> and at length <hi>recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citrauit,</hi> preſumes in owne ſtrength, and turnes vp the heele againſt God, and all goodneſſe. Phyſitians ſay the finer the bread is, the more dangerous is the ſurfet. And euen ſo it is with heauenly foode, by our owne peruerſeneſſe. And therefore this made <hi>Angels Diuels</hi> when they fell once, this loſt <hi>Saul</hi> a kingdome, ouerthrewe <hi>Salomon,</hi> and a multitude ſince to our very dayes, without all remedy and cure. How many doe we know in the world, that knew Gods will, and were in good practiſe of it, yet now are giuen ouer and left to themſelues. They left off firſt one good exerciſe, then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and by little and little all, or very neere all: time and temptation brought them to it, and wearineſſe of well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And this exceeds all other kinde of ſinne, that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may finde remedy when the paſsion is once ouer. This paſsion is neuer ouer, lyes heauy on the ſtomacke like dough: will neither voide vpward at the mouth, ſince they cannot forget what they haue heard and read; nor concoct in the liuer, ſince ſhame is gone that ſhould giue it colour
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150605:14"/>and entertainment. Set all the <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> before them that is in the Goſpell; they tooke a ſurfet of it once, and now will doe them no good. Set <hi>Roſa-ſolis</hi> before them, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of hotteſt ſpirit, all is in vaine: theſe were ſo lately their common drinke, that now at a neede, it will not warme their heart. They are growne to very <hi>inſenſibility</hi> by their owne pertinacity, and if God touch them not extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, they are paſt all recouery.</p>
               <p>But by all theſe properties of bread, yee ſee now by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as before by authority, how fitly our heauenly foode is here called <hi>Bread</hi> by our holy Prophet. And our ſpeech hath not bin onely of words and tearmes, but alſo of effects, and ſubſtance, and true woorth of it indeede. For firſt it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth our ſoule as <hi>Bread</hi> doth our body. Secondly, it makes the pureſt blood, euen the blood of Martyrs and Saints. Thirdly, how it is loued of all that loue themſelues as they ſhould do, and giues honour to the poſſeſſours of it. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

Wee grewe fatte and fedde daintily at his table, and if a fatte man fall, hee hath much adoe to riſe againe. By all which wee may ſee as in a glaſſe, what manner of thing this heauenly foode is wee flye from daily, and liſt not buy. Foode I ſay in a word, foode in worth; a worth not to bee valued by the worthieſt things in the world; not by diamonds, nor yet by a diadem, and a whole diadem were well giuen for it, if it could not bee had without. All the world is ſo baſe and vile to it, that all together will not buy the leaſt peece of true vertue.</p>
               <p>And therefore amongſt other our ſpirituall breads afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, that nouriſh, feede, and beautifie our ſoule: I may not omit to commend vnto you heere moſt eſpecially and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly our <hi>Sacramentall bread,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note> the body and blood of Chriſt,</hi> which hee gaue and ſpilt on the croſſe for the life of the world; and which it may bee was principally intended by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150605:14"/>our holy Prophet in this place. And I doe not commend it to you now for the praiſe of it, but for the the vſe of it; the one beeing beyond my power to performe worthily; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beeing in your power to practiſe proffitably: ye haue price enough in your purſes, as I tolde you, and I would wiſh you to buy of it often. Let not once a yeare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you, which the Church doth binde ye to once a moneth in act, and euery day in deſire, is little enough for thoſe, that know the ſweete of it. Little enough I ſay if wee haue a liuely faith, and haue taſted how good it is.</p>
               <p>But woe bee to vs. Wee apprehend it not, and therefore wee buy it no faſter. Wee feele not the operation of it, and therefore wee neglect it. It is to bee lamented with many teares, how careleſſe wee bee and almoſt inſenſible in this point, as will ſoone bee ſeene by vs, if wee take not heede betimes. Wee are like to a ſea wall, that muſt bee alwaies repayring; which if wee be not by this holy Sacrament, we ſhall goe euery day decaying further from heauen; euery guſt of winde, and ſea will make a breach vpon vs, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little temptation will ſurround vs. It is Gods worke to repaire vs, and not mans. And if wee will bee vertuous by our ſelues, or honeſt of our ſelues, and thinke a Sacrament but an idle ceremony; the next newes will bee of vs, that we haue neither vertue at all in vs, nor ſcarce <hi>common honestie.</hi> All that be faithfull know what they receiue, but all take not delight in it, becauſe they know not the benefit of it: yea more then this, let vs call and cry to them neuer ſo loude, that they will taſte often of it, and try the good of it, as they will doe by ſome thing which is hard, or harſh enough to them at the firſt, but with vſe made pleaſing: yet in this <hi>heauenly Bread</hi> they will not doe it, nor force themſelues a whit to loue it, becauſe it pleaſeth not ſenſe.</p>
               <p>This noble Sacrament hath many good things in it, and the Ancients haue neuer done praiſing it, and extolling it, euen out of their owne feeling. I haue read much, but I reade no Doctor like the Doctor of Doctors, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who beſt could tell what good wee receiue by it.

               <p>Truely, there is no two can bee one, ſo, as wee with God, by this heauenly Bread receiued: not the neereſt friends that are, not the greateſt louers in the world, not Angels, and Seraphins; yet wee are one with God, by receiuing of God.

                  <hi>Et ego in eo,</hi> and I in him; which words Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> expoundeth alſo very well in the ſame place, how God is in vs. Hee tolde vs before, how we dwell in him: now he tels vs, how he dwels in vs. Hee dwels in vs, ſaith he, as in his temple, or place dedicated to his ſeruice: not content with ſtately temples and goodly buildings made with hand, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſtone,

Not thus content I ſay, but makes his chappell of eaſe in our hearts, his tabernacle in our breaſts, his priuy chamber, or cloſſet in our boſomes, to ſit with vs, to conferre with vs, and as it were to ſolace with vs in priuate: <hi>Et ego in eo.</hi> How is this I in him? not in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſort as God is euery where; but in particular, as hee was in <hi>Salomons</hi> temple, when his <hi>Arke</hi> of Teſtimony was brought in.

               <p> Theſe bee great matters I ſpeake of, and wee may not ſlippe them out, nor let them ſlippe from vs lightly. To be all one with God, not with earthly kings; to be vnited with God, not with Angels, or Archangels; to be the temple of God, not a pallace for a Prince; to bee a reſting place for Ieſus, not a couch of golde for <hi>Aſhuerus.</hi> Who can tell what glory this is to vs, what a priuiledge, what an aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſight of the whole heauenly warfare? euen greater then any Prince in the world can euer beſtow on vs, though it were to ſet vs in a throane by him.</p>

               <p>Yee haue hitherto heard what neceſsity there is of this heauenly bread, and ſome part of the benefit of it, and what cauſe our Prophet had to cry out vpon vs as hee doth, for misbeſtowing what wee haue, ſo vily, and not vpon theſe <hi>breads,</hi> for heaping vnworthy things in this world, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the worthieſt, that will ſticke by vs for euer.

               <p>It followes in the ſame place; <hi>your labours,</hi> and not in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie,
<note place="margin">Eſay 55.</note> or fulneſſe.</hi> Now, ſince we haue done with the <hi>bread</hi> of <hi>trauellers;</hi> we ought of right to ſpeake next of the <hi>bread</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> (which was the other part of my deuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) before we leaue bread, &amp; go to anew matter. Howbeit becauſe we haue reſerued this of Angels to be ſpoken of laſt; wee will breake order a little, and goe forward firſt with our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150605:16"/>owne words as they lye; and the other bread we ſhall finde oportunitie for (God willing) at an other time.</p>
               <p>Why ſpend yee your ſiluer (ſaith hee) and not in bread; your labour, and not in ſaturity?

Gods curſe it was vpon <hi>Adam,</hi> that the earth and creatures ſhould rebell againſt him; and nothing he ſhould haue without labour, and toyle;
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>in labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re comedes;</hi> If thou wilt eate, thou muſt labour for it: and in the <hi>ſweat of thy brow ſhall bee thy</hi> foode. He hath ſhewne before, how prodigally wee ſpend our ſubſtance vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, but that wee ſhould. Our will vpon ſelfe-liking; our wit vpon fancies; our vnderſtanding vpon things fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and tranſitory; our learning (if we haue any) vpon ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality; our ſtile or tongue in ſetting foorth a lye, aſſoone as a true tale; our health in paſtime and play, and all that we haue in idle vanities for the moſt part, with little reſpect of God, or of his holy ſeruice, for which onely we were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; inſinuating vnto vs, that if it were not in <hi>bread,</hi> or in order to God, it muſt needs be in one of theſe. Now comes he to our bodies alſo, and the actions thereof; how we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe our ſtrength, how our labour; how our hands and feete, how our ſences: and finding them all no better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed then the other were; that is (to ſay) in hope of eaſe, and yet no true eaſe; in hope of pleaſure, and yet no true pleaſure; in hope of filling, and yet empty; in hope of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,</hi> and yet no true <hi>Saturity;</hi> hee asketh this queſtion as before of our money, and other outward things, ſo now of our <hi>labours,</hi> and cares of life, ſaying: why beſtow yee all theſe things as ye doe, and not in <hi>Saturity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturity</hi> yee muſt thinke is as much to ſay, as fulneſſe of contentment: It is as much to ſay, as I haue enough Lord, <hi>Satis eſt,</hi> I aske no more in this life. It is written of holy <hi>Ephraim</hi> and others,
<note place="margin">Luk. 22. Plat. lib. 3.</note> that were much addicted to prayer and meditation; that they found ſuch extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150605:17"/>therein ſometimes; that they brake forth into theſe words, ſaying; <hi>Satis domine,</hi> enough Lord; as much to ſay, as hold thy hand Lord, I haue enough. Let mee not haue heauen before I come there, I haue enough. And this is not onely their contentment, that are perfect; but it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good bodies, that loues vertue, and delights in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and although he haue not extraordinary comforts, nor can expect thoſe rare illuminations which ſome haue had: yet if hee vſe but an ordinary deuotion in his ordinary courſe of prayers, and reſigne himſelfe wholly to God; he ſhall finde (no doubt) ſo much quickening hope, that hee ſhall riſe from his knees very contentedly with <hi>Satis domine,</hi> and ſuch compleate ſatisfaction, as in his humility, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his vnworthineſſe, hee would thinke is much more, then he could expect.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe, and let this be our ground, that there is no abſolute content in this life, all our content, euen a Saints content vpon earth; is but in <hi>enigmate,</hi> or like the ſunne in a cloude vpon a gloomy day: and therefore holy <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Satiabor cum apparuerit gloria tua</hi> he ſaith not Satior in the preſent,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.</note> but Satiabor in the future tenſe: Signifying here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; that there is no <hi>ſaciety</hi> in this life, no perfect filling, or ſaturity here; it muſt be in heauen, not here; it is in viſion of God, not in fruition of creatures; wee are here but in expectation, there in poſſesſion; here in hope, and promiſe, there in deede and performance; here in fight, there in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; here like hunters, and ſouldiers, there wee deuide the ſpoiles. The ſouldier in his fore-age is glad of any thing he can get, and ſaith <hi>Satis.</hi> The faulconer likewiſe, or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is well pleaſed for the time at a poore mans houſe, and ſaith <hi>Satis</hi> for it, as if he were at home in richer fare. And this is the beſt of our caſes here. Wee are all ſouldiers in this <hi>magno campo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudi. 1.</note> or great battle of the world. Wee are huntſ-men in this wilde forreſt, or chace of beaſts, and ſaua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, our owne appetites, and inordinate deſires; which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wee kill, and ſometimes they eſcape our hands. But in the time of this our hunting, we are glad many times to meete with a fountaine in ſtead of a tauerne to coole our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150605:17"/>thirſt; a little hope I ſay, in ſtead of a poſſeſsion, a feruent thought now and then inſtead of a preſent imbrace: and this is <hi>Satis,</hi> and ſweete to vs, vntill wee come home at night, that is (to ſay) in the end of our life, to our heauenly dwelling; where wee ſhall haue indeede, not onely our true <hi>Satis,</hi> but <hi>Satis ſuper<expan>
                        <am>

                     </expan>,</hi> and ſhall haue no end of enough.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſſe I ſay that the life of the vertuous in this world is in hunger and thirſt, and in a longing after heauen: yea all their life is in defection, and fainting; for ſo ſaith Dauid, <hi>concupiſcit, &amp; deficit anima mea in atria domini,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 83.</note> my ſoule doth luſt, and faint withall, vntill it enter the houſe of God. Yet what of this? is there therefore no contentment in it? See I pray what hee ſaies in the very ſame place,
<note place="margin">ibid.</note> and verſe? My heart and fleſh (ſaith hee) haue leapt for ioy, that I ſhall come to my louing God. Loe heere how he anſwers the matter himſelfe; hee fainteth, and yet hee exulteth: he was ready to dye, and yet hee leapeth for ioy. And ſo in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, <hi>Mine eyes begin to faile mee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 68.</note> while I hope in my God. See heere a notable <hi>Sympathy</hi> in an <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord as it were in a holy diſcord, a fainting and leaping both at one time, a defection and exultation both at a breath, a ſwounding and reuiuing all in a verſe, all at an inſtant. So as, let our diſcomfort bee neuer ſo great, beeing for God, and in a longing after him: ſuch diſcomfort can be no true diſcomfort, that is ſo full of comfort; no true dulneſſe or heauineſſe, that is ſo quicke with childe of ſo great hopes, or of ſo hopefull an inheritance.</p>
               <p>It farre exceedes the comfort of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who thought it little to ſerue ſeauen yeares for faire <hi>Rachel,</hi> beeing ſure to haue her in the ende. Our enioying alſo lyes in our willes: Wee are as ſure of it as wee are ſure of our willes; fire and water cannot part vs, if wee loue and like.
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> What is there in the world ſhould beate vs from this hope? can tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation? can pouerty, or any thing elſe? Yea, doe not croſſes encreaſe our comforts, as water increaſeth fire?
<note place="margin">Prou. 15.</note> Theſe be the comforts that <hi>Salomon</hi> calles <hi>Iuge conuiuium,</hi> or all day feaſting.
<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.</note> How can wee bee ſorrowfull in a feaſt full of harmony? To this content or ſaciety, doth Saint <hi>Peter</hi> invite you, ſaying <hi>Sat agite,</hi> that is (to ſay) <hi>Satis agite.</hi> Doe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150605:18"/>as much as lyes in you for your contentment, which ye may gather by him, can no where elſe bee had, but in a morall certainety of your vocation, and election, and your true concurring therewithall. This the comfort of comforts, and well head of true content, or higheſt toppe of our <hi>Satis</hi> in this life. What life can bee in ſorrow, that is indowed with this? and they that haue this, whatſoeuer they bee, or haue beene, may ioy and exult at all times. Let miſeries come like hayle vpon vs, yet can wee not bee vnhappy, as long as wee haue this. Let our eſtate for life bee what it will be, ſo we be ſure of our inheritance: our perpetuall hope of this, and our will ſtill concurring with our hope, is it that nouriſheth ſo, as, wee can aske no more in this life, whereſoeuer wee become; in paine or pleaſure, among friends or enemies, in ſleepe or awake, in trauell or at reſt, in plenty or penury, peace or warre, in buſineſſe or at quiet; ſtill our <hi>Satis</hi> attends vs, and wee carry content where wee goe, in tryumph about vs.</p>
               <p>And theſe comforts if wee will imbrace them as wee bee offered them, are the earneſt pennies that tye vs to God, and him to vs, vnleſſe we goe from it firſt our ſelues. Theſe our claime to a future inheritance, or a poſſeſsion keeping againſt the diuell and his angels for the places they had, and loſt in heauen, and wee muſt haue after them. This the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis domine</hi> that holy <hi>Dauid</hi> felt in his ſoule and ſpirit, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 76.</note> 
                  <hi>Renuit conſolari anima mea, memor fui dei, &amp; delectatus ſum.</hi> So delighted hee to thinke of his part he had in God, that hee founde himſelfe vnable to holde the comfort of it. Now what comfort is there abroade in the world, that they will ſay to God <hi>Satis domine</hi> with the Saints aforeſaide; or <hi>Renuit conſolari anima mea</hi> with <hi>Dauid?</hi> is there any will ſay, Lord thou giueſt mee to much? Forbeare. Will they not ſay rather giue mee more Lord, I haue not enough? I haue no contentment yet for want of more? This is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hearts eaſe, this is the contentment and ſaciety our Prophet ſpeakes of heere, and findes fault that wee labour and toyle as we doe, and not in this Saturity.</p>
               <p>My good friends, I haue tolde you in briefe, what Satu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150605:18"/>it is, that hee meaneth, and is truely in Gods ſeruants, and no where elſe to bee founde. Will any man contend with mee, and ſay it is in the world; it is where riches are, it is where pleaſures are, it is with kings and mighty folke? I cannot deny, but ſuch perſons haue contentment. They do what they wil, and their pleaſures are prouided for them without their trouble. They are tyed to no rule, tyed to no law, keepe no houres, day nor night. If they bee ſicke, the Phyſitian is at their elbowe. What ſhould I ſpeake of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? they may wallowe in gold, if they will. What of faire houſes and dainty gardens well ſette, and planted with plumbes, and fruits of the beſt. None to contradict them in their deſires, none to croſſe them in any ſort. I ſpeake not of inferiour perſons, whoſe content (it may be) is not, nor can bee ſo abſolute as theſe. And yet as great content they may ſeeme to haue in their leſſe, and meaner eſtate, as the other in their grand ſuperfluities: yet few of them can ſay <hi>Satis,</hi> or thinke they haue enough, as deuout people can: but ſeeke for more, labour for more, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet for more the moſt of them, as if they had nothing: yea I haue knowne ſome confeſſe, that for wanting a little of their willes or wiſhes, it hath troubled them more, then if they had nothing. And of this there can bee no other true reaſon, but that they bee no true contentments, but falſe and deceitfull, as I could eaſily prooue, if my purpoſe were to inſiſt on it.</p>
               <p>This alone may ſuffice for this point, that the heathen Philoſopher, who reached no higher then morality, ſawe as much as I tell you, and founde no true contentment but in Philoſophy, &amp; wiſedome, and in vertuous contemplation. In reſpect whereof, he contemned all baſſer matters; pleaſures they held both counterfeit and foule. And if any man thinke them truely delightfull,
<note place="margin">eth. 10. dial. de rep.</note> the fault is in his corrupted minde (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) that lookes no higher. And <hi>Plato</hi> likewiſe will haue no true content in riches or pleaſures, and they <q>that fight and ſcratch for them, as they doe (ſaith hee) are like beaſts that feede downeward and creepe on their bellies, and neuer looke vp as men ſhould, towards their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150605:19"/>true contentment.</q> Thus ſaith hee; and he makes no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of riches; and the greateſt pleaſures hee holdes but ſhaddowes of pleaſures,
<note place="margin">Steſichorus</note> as a very ancient <hi>Poet</hi> was wont to ſay, whom he there auoucheth for this purpoſe thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>For Hellen faire, as Troians thought,</l>
                  <l>But not true Hellen, Troians fought.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And to this effect they all agree moſt conſtantly, not ſwaruing a iot one from an other, and by no other light, then by naturall reaſon; that there is no true <hi>Satis</hi> in any of all theſe; and therefore no maruell if it cannot bee founde among them that bee ſenſuall, and more then purblinde of Soule, as moſt people are.</p>
               <p>And yet to come neerer our prophets meaning in this place, and to make a full benefit of it for our greater good; let vs ſearch a little further, ſince wee haue ſaid what Saturity it is hee ſpeaketh of heere, who and what they bee alſo that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour thus (as hee ſaith) without it, and who they bee I ſay that take ſo much paines, and haue not their fill.</p>
               <p>Wee knowe a great many in the world, that as they haue not their fill greatly; ſo take they but little paines or labour for it. And therefore ſurely our Prophet meaneth not any of theſe, becauſe they bee not of thoſe that labour. They liue by other bodies labours, and doe nothing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. They are idle and lazie, and will bee troubled with nothing, but looke that euery thing ſhould be put into their mouthes: whether our Prophet meanes theſe or no, I muſt giue them a touch by the way, becauſe they ſwarme ſo in our countrey. Oh how farre doe wee degenerate from our Anceſtours. Our nobility and gentry for the moſt part are corrupted with idleneſſe. Be it ſpoken without offence. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be Magiſtrates, officers, or houſekeepers, ſtudents, ſouldiers imployed, merchants, tradeſmen, or husbandmen; I dare boldly ſay it, for the moſt part of them, they haue ſo litle care of beſtowing their time well, that they were better holde the plough then bee ſo nobly idle as they bee. They cannot tell at night, what good they haue done that day, as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150605:19"/>euery labourer can. But where idle company leades them, there they goe, there they play, there they wrangle or make merry, looſe their time, looſe their money and meanes, and make themſelues buſineſſe to ſhift for more. Moſt of our young folke make fooles of themſelues, that are otherwiſe well enough indued.</p>
               <p>Is it not a ſhame to ſee how intemperate they be of their dyet, how inconſtant in their houres, how vnſtable in their actions, how wauering in their gate, how new fangled in their apparell, how fond and wild in their conuerſation, how affectat in their words, how heathen-like euery way, and ignorant in all Chriſtian duties? one takes it of another like a diſeaſe; euery vpſtart or countrey ladde will be as proude, and idle as the beſt, if hee come in place, and can holde vp his noſe aloft, carry a feſcue in his mouth, and anſwer not a word to any man without three or foure askings. Their exerciſe is to ſleepe long, and to meditate on their miſtreſſe till almoſt dinner time. Then to <hi>Tobacco,</hi> then to dinner ſomewhere, then to a play, or a Tobacco-houſe, or elſe in pilgrimage from one idle body to another. He ſpends his time rarely, if he take a viall in hand and ſing to it; then to ſupper, then to gaming or Tobacco againe till midnight, or other like daliance vntill they be weary.</p>
               <p>His bookes be <hi>Amades,</hi> or <hi>Ariosto,</hi> or an <hi>Arcadia,</hi> or if theſe be to high for him, <hi>a play booke</hi> or ſome ſuch fancy as the world is full of, to while himſelfe withall, for want of company. Much like my ladies dogge, that doth nothing but eate, drinke, and ſleepe, or lye in a lappe. Sometimes he barkes, then to his cuſhion againe, then vp into the bedde, then downe againe to the fire, then whines to the lappe againe: ſo fares it with our idle folkes, void of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, voide of reſolution, voide of grace, or very little ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with it. Holding it moſt ridiculous to ſpeake of Chriſt, or holy things, vnleſſe it be to ſweare by them: ſeldome praying but for a faſhion, imitating <hi>Angels</hi> in nothing but in <hi>celerity,</hi> who ſhall ſay faſteſt: begin perhaps with <hi>domine ne in furore</hi> and within two or three ſnappes after, are at <hi>valde velociter.</hi> Quickly in bedde, long in riſing, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150605:20"/>and making ready, giuen to no good exerciſe, but eaſe and fatneſſe vntill they bee gray and readie for a graue.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, euery one hath his humour, and is ledde by the noſe with it like a <hi>beare;</hi> giues way to all paſsions, and that is valiant with him. I haue ſeene ſome <hi>Neroes</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itellij</hi> amongſt them for ſpending, and ingurgitating. I thinke they would ſpend ſeauen millions (if they had it) in fewe moneths ſpace,
<note place="margin">Suet.</note> as the one of theſe did; or a thouſand ſorts of fiſh at a meale, and as many of foule as the other did, or be alwaies inuenting new pleaſures, as both did, if it were not for very ſhame. For I make no ſcruple to iudge the worſt of them by the abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the heart, that breaks out at their tongues ends, and at their deboyſht faſhions vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerable. But theſe be the worthieſt, they may ſeeme to follow, and none elſe. They will ſeeme to be braue minded, and yet will follow the baſeſt.</p>
               <p>They might learne if they pleaſed of that noble <hi>Romane Sertorius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plut.</note> to hate their owne vile conditions, and liue more like men. Hee was fellowe with Princes, though in baniſht eſtate. And he was ſought vnto by kings. It will diſparage no man to follow him. <hi>Metellus</hi> refuſed ſingle combate with him, and <hi>Pompey</hi> twice driuen out of the field: yet was he humble to all, deere to his followers, pittifull to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, chaſt of body, ſober of carriage, and might not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide a diſſolute body, that were alwaies talking of women, and wantonneſſe. Another like to him was <hi>Ageſilaus a grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Prince,</hi> who although he were amorous, yet modeſt in word, and action; content with any mirth but impudicities; and if the contrary had beene offered, he gaue it a proud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, or a deafe eare. How many examples be there of ſuch in our bookes, and how many noble chriſtians both dead, and aliue, very imitable in this kinde. But ours had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follow <hi>Hanniball;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iuſt.</note> and ſo let them; for there was not a more worthy for all qualities belonging to a gentleman, nor any more ſober or continent then he, or that tooke more paines, or that leſſe loued idlenes then he.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150605:20"/>They ſcorne to be ignorant of any thing, yet make no vſe of it, but lippe witte.

                  <note place="margin">Plut.</note> that his people had no roome to doe any thing, they were affraide of nothing more then of idleneſſe; their enemy troubled them not ſo much without the walles, as idleneſſe within. But their worthy captaine prouided for them very well, deuiſed new exerciſes of ſtrength, and motion, ſuch as their little roome would allow of, either in his hall, or in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corners. And ſome hee made ouerſeers of the reſt. The very horſes they would not let be idle, but kept them in breath, with hanging them in ſuch ſort, that they could ſcarce touch ground with their forefeete, and then bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured them ſo with ſticke, and voice; that they ſweat, and groand againe. Others walked them, till they were coole. Others ground barley for them. There was not a gentleman that refuſed to doe any thing to keepe him from idleneſſe.</p>
               <p>Idleneſſe is the corrupter of all good manners,
<note place="margin">Plut. in mor.</note> no vertue hath poſſeſsion (ſaith one <hi>Philoſoper</hi>) where a man is not in ſome good action. Idleneſſe hath beene equally puniſhed heretofore with murther or theft. Others made it but ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150605:21"/>others made it fineable. <hi>Atheus perſicus</hi> made them worſe then horſe rubbers,
<note place="margin">in Licurgo. Strobeus ſer. 42.</note> that were idle. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> prouided ſo, that none could be idle; all perſons had enough to doe in their place.

                  <hi>Amaſis</hi> likewiſe a moſt wiſe king who reigned foure and forty yeares ouer the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> made a law vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paine of death,
<note place="margin">Plut. in Sympo.</note> that euery man ſhould once a yeare giue an accompt of his life, and actions, and how he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained himſelfe: and he appointed Pretours of purpoſe to take this accompt.
<note place="margin">Sueto.</note> This law did <hi>Auguſtus</hi> like ſo well of, that he made the like in Rome. And <hi>Solon</hi> long before him brought the ſame to <hi>Athens,</hi> to roote out of the citty vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable weedes, that ſucke out the iuyce and foyſon of the earth, and bring nothing againe; take the fruite of it, and giue no fruite againe. The oxe feedes by vs, and giues vs his fleſh to eate; the cowe feedes, and giues ſweet milke for it; the ſheepe feeds, and giues vs cloathing to our backs; and our horſe carries vs for his meate. Onely our idle bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies take all they can, giue nothing againe; and ſince they will not be their owne lawe, it is great pitty, that the law of <hi>Amaſis</hi> is not amongſt them.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould tell you more ſtories in this kinde; happly I ſhould pleaſe you, more then my ſelfe. It is not the <hi>Roman</hi> nor the <hi>Grecian,</hi> or <hi>Spartan</hi> that I ſeeke for: but the true Chriſtian.
<note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> Woe be to thee <hi>Corozain,</hi> as our Sauiour ſaith: ſo woe be to thee ſo idle a Chriſtian whatſoeuer. For if Chriſt had walked the Egyptian ſtreetes, if Chriſt had beene prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of the Romane pulpits, if Pagans had had ſuch a marke to ſhoote at, as wee in the eyes of our faith haue; had it beene ſaid to them,
<note place="margin">Mat. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>why ſtand yee heere idlely,</hi> and haue a world of your owne to thinke of in heauen, which will not be had with out thinking, and labouring? they would not haue needed ſuch lawes as I ſpeake of, nor would haue ſtood gaping ſo idlely about them, as we doe, and care not which end goes forward.</p>
               <p>And therefore ô yee flower of our nation that are here together, the hope of your friends, &amp; not the meaneſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150605:21"/>of your countries expectation. Whoſe anceſtours were not idle when then they carried the lillies farre and neere, and extended your borders ſo wide, and large; nor idle when they defended your frontiers, built your cities, tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, townes, caſtles, and Churches without number; not idle in ſo many foundations, and noble monuments, which they haue left behind them to the glory of God, and honour of our nation; not idle when they bred you, and brought you vp to that you now bee. And your ſelues alſo not idle hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, either in your times of march, or dayes of truce. Nay, I know not whether any in the world were in better buſineſſe then you; not ſcorning the meaneſt offices in the field, or campe; or about your owne perſons, when yee had others to doe it for you. Yet ſomewhat ye would bee doing alwaies with your owne horſe, or armour, or drying your owne powder, or accommodating your pike, or picking and pruning your petronell, obſeruing euer ſo willingly your leaders voice; and ſeruing God continually in word, and thought. Let not this idle canker (I ſay) come neere your doores hereafter, or ſet any footing where you haue to doe. Flie it, ſhunne it, auoide it, as you would a houſe that hath the plague in it.</p>
               <p>Take heede I beſeech you of this vnprofitable idleneſſe, that will bee ready to aſſault you when you come home. And beware no leſſe of idle hangers on. I am very vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table my ſelfe; but rather then I would bee as ſome are, I wiſh my ſelfe a ſtone, or a peece of wood, that ſomewhat might bee made of mee. There is not a ſticke of wood, but will make ſomewhat. Either a bowe, or a bedde-ſtaffe, or a toppe, or a tyle-pinne. But our idle bodies ſerue for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. They are neither good for God, nor the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, nor themſelues. Not for God, but to practiſe his iudgements vpon. Not for the common-wealth, but to eate vp their prouiſion before it be ſpoiled, and to drinke vp their pots by yards, or dozens if that bee good. Neither are they for themſelues; that put not out their wit, nor that they haue to the moſt, no, not to any aduantage for their eternall good. Knowing well enough that they may not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150605:22"/>liue heere alwaies. One day the dolefull bell muſt ring out for them, their eye-liddes cloſed vp, their face caſt ouer with a cloath, their body laid out vpon colde boardes, the ſoule wandring the whileſt in a very ſtrange countrey, darke and diſmall, not a man or angell to ſpeake for it, nor any to bid welcome, but a ſort of miſhapen and angry monſters.</p>
               <p>Idleneſſe will bee pittifully paid for at that day, and ſo I ſo I leaue them. If they haue nothing elſe to doe, let them be humble, and learne their <hi>Catechiſme</hi> by heart againe; or goe to ſome heauenly broker, as they went in the goſpell to Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist;</hi> or as they in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that came to the Apoſtles, to know what they ſhould doe, or how they might put out with ſafety any hability they had. Yea the Scripture there ſayes more.
<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> That they were <hi>compuncti corde,</hi> their hearts (as it were) bled within them, when they heard of their duties. Oh that your hearts would bleede likewiſe, though I bee but a worme that ſpeake to you at this time, for lacke of a better. Yet I doe wiſh that this duty of yours were as deepely conceiued by you, as it deepely concernes you; to the end that yee aske alwaies as they did, <hi>quid fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciemus,</hi> what ſhall wee doe? or what amends ſhall wee make for time paſt? how ſhall wee beſtowe our ſelues hereafter? how ſhall wee ſpend our idle houres? how the forenoone, how the afternoone, that no more time may be loſt? Truely it will not hurt a man to aske; neither will it bee trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to any friend that loues you, to reſolue you. But yet if my counſell bee not pleaſing to ſome, I would wiſh them yet, to doe as the great <hi>Turke</hi> doth, (I would it were the worſt hee did) to profeſſe ſome <hi>mechanicall</hi> art, to keepe him from idleneſſe. This man maketh rings for bowe-men, his father made arrowes well. And if a gentleman can paint or limme, or imborder for his exerciſe, or haue skill of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening, and planting either fruite or fuell, or make, or mend any thing that belongs to himſelfe, or his horſe, it will not diſparage him.</p>
               <p>And this I ſpeake the rather before you that be Souldiers, becauſe your courſe of life I ſee is very actiue, or very idle. Your skill for the moſt part goes no further then <hi>Mars.</hi> Ye
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150605:22"/>haue learnt nothing elſe heere; and if <hi>Mars</hi> haue no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for you at home, yee will fall to worſe courſes; which I would bee loath to heare of any of you, and yet idleneſſe will diſpoſe you to it, whether ye will or no. Gray haires will grow vpon you quickly, and yee ſhall not know for what. Bethinke your ſelues ſuddainely what courſe yee will take, to paſſe your time profitably, and to preuent the extreame euills that idleneſſe brings. The Philoſopher ſaith, there is no <hi>vacuum in rerum natura,</hi> from the top of heauen,
<note place="margin">Ariſt. phi.</note> to the center, there is nothing voide of ſome ſubſtance. And as the law of nature admits no emptineſſe, ſo let your manly nature allow of no idlenes, but fill it vp with good thoughts at the leaſt, to keepe out this idle <hi>vacuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I haue ſtoode ſomewhat long vpon your idle folkes, and vpon idleneſſe, becauſe it is the bane of common-weales, and ruine of moſt houſes. And I would haue both publike, and priuate to take notice of their daily danger, which is ſooner felt then auoided. Yet theſe bee not they our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeakes of, as I ſaid before: for theſe bee but idle, and take no paines; <hi>In labore hominum non ſunt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 72.</note> they be no paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, but eaſe-takers. And hee ſpeaketh of thoſe heere, that labour and are alwaies toyling about ſomewhat; and whom it ſeemeth hee takes pitty of, in that they trauell, and ſweate about ſuch things, as giue no true contentment, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity at all to their ſoules. There bee two ſorts of theſe, that take paines, and care in the world without this Saturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The firſt is of them that labour, and yet eate not at all, for all their labour. They feede not of our Bread aforeſaid, and therefore no maruell if they bee not filled. The more one labours, the further off from filling, if hee feede not. The other is of them that labour and feede, and yet they thriue not greatly, nor are filled. They tafte and feede (I ſay) of the Breads I ſpake of in my firſt part; but they feed more ſparingly then they neede, hauing ſuch plenty before them. And theſe be thoſe our Prophet ſpeakes of properly; that take paines about many things, when one thing onely is neceſſary; labour ſo much for Tranſitories,
<note place="margin">Luk. 10.</note> that they are the weaker for it to things eternall.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:150605:23"/>
               <p> The firſt ſort ſurely comes not within his meaning in this place, beeing notorious ſinners, and ſuch as labour for wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ends. Of whom it may bee ſaid <hi>iam iudicati ſunt,</hi> they haue Iudgement of hell vpon them already. And who bee theſe but extortioners, and wringers, that care not how they get, ſo they get. Who elſe? but the proude, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and malitious perſons, men and women. Who elſe? the backbiter, tale-carrier, and make-bate. Who elſe? drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards and ſwearers, that doe nothing but fret, and chafe, and make a noiſe; quarrellers alſo, and laſciuious perſons, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall gameſters. None of theſe be ſaued almoſt without a miracle. For they will not ſo much as taſte of any thing that ſhould do them good. If they would but taſte, haply they might haue their fill at one time, or other. But they wil none of it, and ſo I leaue them alſo. It is neither theſe our Prophet ſpeakes of, being in no way at all, no, not in the firſt ſtep to Saturity: neither is it of idle bodies as I ſaid before, becauſe they labour not at all. It is the other ſort onely (as I take it) that is here intended, and meant; whoſe endeauors are for the moſt part to honeſtends, and their buſines commonly not vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>Such I ſay as haue a deſire to be ſaued and vſe meanes for it, but very coldely many times, and very confuſedly. Coldly, becauſe it is with feruour too little. Confuſedly, becauſe it is mixed, and interlaced, and ouerborne as it were with worldly contentments. Ye know, if droſſe &amp; filth get into our veines, the blood will ſoone be tainted with it, and cannot giue that nouriſhment it ſhould; but turnes to bad humors, &amp; bring vs to that plight, that although we feede with the beſt, yet we thriue not with the beſt. We looke like men that ſhould bee hardy and ſtrong, but we prooue like women in the greene ſicknes. We looke pale and leane on it in Gods ſight, and not worth the ground we tread on. When we pray and our mind is fraught with other things; when we come to the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; put not away all rancor; what is this, but to ſop our bread in the channell, or our meate in the duſt of an olde poſt, or to eate rawe fleſh, or to poure in water into our <hi>Aqua-vitae.</hi> I will not ſay but here is labour, and care, and meanes alſo vſed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150605:23"/>for the good of the Soule. But it can neuer bee fat thus, nor haue Saturity. It will liue, though it be wan and pale; it will breath, though it be ſallowe and greene; it will goe forward though faintly; it will thriue a little, but not much.

                  <hi>Labor labori laborem imponit,</hi> as they ſay. One labour begets another in this world, one labour muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and perfect other, or elſe all is imperfect. There is labour in tilling, labour in ſowing, labour in weeding, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in reaping, inning, and thraſhing it out; after this, it muſt be grounde, and ſet on our board. If any of theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours be miſsing, there comes no fulneſſe, or ſaturity of it. It will be labour without ſaturity. What ſecurity haue huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band men to mowe their graſſe, and neuer make it; to reape their wheate, and to leaue it in the field to weather, and birds? What ſecurity finde merchants in loading, fraigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, launching, and putting into hauen, if they leaue all on ſhip board when they haue done, for euery body to ſteale, and bring them not into their warehouſe? And this is that our Prophet ſpeakes of here, our labour muſt bee <hi>contimando:</hi> he inueighes not here againſt notorious ſinners, or damned crewes; Such as the world is full of, and the Scriptures are full againſt them in other places. But the Prophecies here againſt them, that are in their way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and make no more haſte in it; will be put by with euery toy; goe forward one day, backward another; doe well one day, ill another; amend one day, fall to it againe an other; haue good meate before them, and eate no better of it: eate well perhaps, but heede not what they ſwallow with it.</p>
               <p>They forbeare ſinne what they can, but watch not their bad inclinations; are good to the poore, but reuengefull to their enemy, are giuen to faſting, and prayer, yet are way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and teſty to their liues ende. Others bee milde, but negligent withall; ſtout but ſtiffe withall, wiſe but opina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, forward but inflexible, obedient but againſt their wils; praiſe worthy but glorying in it. It will prooue <hi>inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis labor.</hi> I feare me in the end. And their worke may turne to froth for all their labour in a great many; or elſe ſo full of traſh, as the bloud of Chriſt can doe no more then waſh
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150605:24"/>it away. There can be no vertue or goodnes in vs without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, no patience or perſeuerance without labor, no withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding temptations, or praier fruitfull without labor; &amp; if we labor in none of theſe, it is aſigne that we hauenone of theſe.</p>
               <p>Now what ſhould I ſpeake of zeale and feruour of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ought to be our wings to heauen-ward? whether be theſe fledde? What wicked fiend, or accurſed fortune of ours hath blowne them away? What coaſt, or forraine countrey hath rauiſhed them from vs; that wee may goe ſeeke them, and fetch them home againe, and make much of them, when we haue them? and will this be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour alſo? I would to God we ſaw, what is yet to bee ſeene, and daily comes to our eares by merchants, and trauellers of the furtheſt parts of the earth? What loue and zeale thoſe <hi>Paynims</hi> beare both young and old of both ſexes to their gods, that are no gods. It would make vs aſhamed of our extreame coldnes, and indeuotion to our true God; if we ſaw it. Yea what will they be, and how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, when they come to be conuerted (as it may be) ſince they are now ſo deuout to Idols or <hi>Pago-des</hi> as they call them, the handy workes of men? There were to be ſeene in the old teſtament,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 105.</note> that offered their children to ſacrifice in their blind zeale. There bee now in the <hi>Jndies</hi> that ſacrifice themſelues daily to pleaſe their god, and they thinke it no labour becauſe we ſpeake of labour, nor ſticke at any paines that can bee, in their wicked ſeruice. Haply yee will not beleeue what I ſhall tell you, but there bee thouſands liuing to teſtifie it: neither doe I ſpeake it, as fit for vs to follow, yet not vnfit to make vſe of; that we may learne to labour the good we may, by them that labour in euill which they may not.</p>
               <p>Of certain they are there ſo full of deuotion, &amp; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all ſorts are ſo obſequious to their <hi>Pago-des;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſt. Alex.</note> that the king of <hi>Cochine</hi> not long ſince holden for a prudent prince, and a man of notable gouernment, left his gouernment wholly, and in habit of a poore man, went a fiue yeares pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, to viſit all the <hi>pago-des</hi> of <hi>India</hi> al alone vnknown; where hee indured much miſery and ſorrow before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150605:24"/>and yet ſuch comfort he tooke in it belike, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſuch another voyage afterward, but died in it.</p>
               <p>His ſucceſſour likewiſe that followed him, tooke after him vnfortunately. For being but of weake conſtitution, yet v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing great auſterity to himſelfe many houres in a day in his cloſet alone, with ſuperſtitious meditations, which were moſt hurtfull to his health, hee died within the yeare. Yet ſee his feruour. Vpon a day the gouernour of <hi>Cochine</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed him, and beſought him, to haue more care of his health, alleadging the Phiſitions opinions, that the long ceremonies, and much ſolitarineſſe, which he vſed for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, would quickly hazzard him, or coſt him his life. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the king ſet light by any thing hee could ſay; and told him further, that he made more reckoning of the leaſt of his deuotions to the <hi>Pago-des,</hi> then of an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand liues; all which if he had them, he would ſpend in their ſeruice. There be ſome kings and great Lords in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that for the reuerence they beare to their <hi>Pago-des,</hi> they haue little ones of gold hanging at their forehead, and doe their deuotions to them at their times, with great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. And to the end they may not forget it, they haue their pages of purpoſe, that haue nothing elſe to doe, but to put them in mind of their houres, and to name but the name of the <hi>pago-des,</hi> whereat the King will bowe himſelfe with great reuerence. In the night time alſo, theſe pages awake their maſters for the ſame cauſe.</p>
               <p>But that which exceedeth all admiration is a terrible feaſt, which they hold at <hi>Garcopa</hi> a little from <hi>Onor,</hi> on a certaine day. And this is ſuch a dreadfull thing, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are forbidden to goe thither vpon paine of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. On this feſtiuall day, there is an infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people to attend it. The <hi>Pago-de</hi> with certaine of the <hi>Brachmans</hi> comes forth in a chariot very richly ſet out, the wheeles whereof are tyred with Iron, as piercing and ſharpe as a razor. And as the chariot marches, there comes a number to offer their liues to the <hi>Pago-de,</hi> and caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues on their knees in the lowlieſt manner they can, vntill by little and little they lye flat on the earth, iuſt where the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150605:25"/>wheele muſt come ouer them, and cuttes them all to pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and theſe bee holden for Saints, as our Martyrs are with vs.</p>
               <p>In the other parts of <hi>India</hi> about the borders of <hi>Choro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandell,</hi> of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and in other places likewiſe, the <hi>Pago-de</hi> is carried vpon mens ſhoulders; where the <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> that carry it make as though the god will goe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they not able to carry it further. And it may bee that the Diuell doth preſſe them ſo hard, that they cannot ſtirre indeede. Then come there many (that are neuer wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at ſuch a time) who ſtabbe themſelues to death and there fall downe before it. And yet the <hi>Pago-de</hi> will not ſtirre, vntill the number be full, as the deuill or Brachmans would haue it. And then they goe forward to the temple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, well loaden with the ſpoyle of thoſe damned crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures both body and ſoule. Yet this they do, and thinke they doe their god ſeruice in it. And ſhall ariſe no doubt in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt vs. Who know the true God, and yet are ſo ſpiritleſſe, and dull in his true ſeruice, as we be.</p>
               <p>There is no neede of ſliceing, and wounding our ſelues as they doe; yet it will not hurt vs to leape out of a warme bedde ſometimes for a <hi>Pater noſter</hi> while, either to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an ill thought aſſayling vs, or to pray for them that haue no where to lye, or for them that be in danger that night by ſea, or land, or if we chance to heare a paſsing bell. God forbid we ſhould kill or miſdiet our ſelues with ouer much care; and yet to pinch our ſelues a little for the poore, or for abating our fleſh that it rebell not, are teſtimonies to our conſcience that we feare, and loue God. Wee will not leaue our needefull buſineſſe at randon; and yet we will take our times to talke with God in ſecret, or at publique prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and thinke long to be at it. If wee haue a charge, wee may not neglect it; yet well may we thinke, that any act of deuotion is more noble in it ſelfe, then the mannaging of a kingdome. Wee will not lye groueling a whole Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both till ſunne ſette,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 6. Pſal. 118.</note> as many Iewes doe; yet let vs not thinke much to labour in our prayer with groaning as king <hi>Dauid</hi> did. And if we cannot doe it ſeauen times a day as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150605:25"/>hee did, yet once a day or a weeke it were noble, and would profit vs much to pray ſo, as if wee ſhould then dye.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 9.19.</note> they that ſet light by litle things, by litle ſhall decay. Neither are they ſo little, as they can be done without labour. If wee repent vs of our ſinnes; is this all? Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tels vs, that hee knewe many repenters, but fewe that did the workes that belongs to it. If we faſt, is this enough? our Prophet tels vs in another place, that our willes are founde in our faſtings. <hi>We labour</hi> not to weede out our owne willes,
<note place="margin">Eſay 58. 1. Cor. 5. 1. Reg. 16.</note> nor to ſeuer our ſowre leauen from that which is pure. God lookes not on the ſtoutneſſe of our perſon, or highneſſe of our worke, but on our lowlineſſe and meekenes withall: and loues vs more for one act of Mortification, then if wee gained him thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; yea although it were the whole kingdome of <hi>Turkie.</hi> One temptation well encountred, or paſsion ouercome, is more glorious in his ſight, then all the conqueſts of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> or the triumph of <hi>Aemilius.</hi> And this is the labour God requires of vs, and I exhort yee to. This the labour our Prophet ſpeaketh of, and hath Saturity. And the want of this Labour brings that heauy ſentence vpon vs, which fewe doe marke, or take note of. I beſeech you marke what our Sauiour ſaith to this purpoſe.
<note place="margin">Luk. 13.24</note> 
                  <hi>Multi querunt intrare</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>&amp; non poterunt,</hi> Many ſhall ſeeke to enter heauen and cannot. What a ſaying is this, that many ſhall ſeeke to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150605:26"/>enter and cannot enter? whom will not ſuch a ſentence ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, or not make him, or compell him to ſtirre about this buſineſſe, although he were halfe dead? but what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this ſentence? No other but this. They ſeeke and ſit ſtill. They goe forward, but mend no pace; the bridegroome is come, and gone the whileſt. They cannot abide to ſweate at it, or take paines. They cry <hi>Domine, Domine,</hi> and will not put out their hand. The Labour is not hard, yea the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then light, and yet they will not lye vnder it. It is little more paines then to ſee a play: and yet they will not doe the one, when they doe the other daily. The Play-houſe doore is lowe, and narrow, and yet they ſticke not to ſtoope, and rend their cloathes with crowding. It is beſet with bils and halberds, and they may haue a knocke, and yet they feare nothing. They may looſe their purſes or ſomewhat elſe, and yet they will aduenture. It will coſt them money when they enter, and a great many ſit vneaſie for their money, or in danger of infection, and yet they weigh it not. Who <hi>labours</hi> for heauen thus? who ſeekes heauen ſo laboriouſly, feares no difficulty, ſcornes no diſgrace, ſets light by loſſe, or a blowe, biddes for the beſt place, and will haue no nay vntill they bee in it? They that ſeeke heauen thus, ſhall bee ſure to enter. And they that ſeeke it not thus; the ſentence is ginen <hi>non poterunt,</hi> they doe but goe by, and looke at the place; but they cannot goe in, as our Sauiour ſaith. And this may ſuffice for the ſecond point, which was <hi>Labour and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,</hi> whereby to ſtirre you, and haſten you, in your way to heauen. There be two things belong to haſte. The one is to know the readieſt way: the next to looſe no time in our ſpeede, if the matter bee of importance. There is nothing imports vs more, then our heauenly inheritance. And I haue ſhewne the next way thither out of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vertuous life, hearing, reading, and often receiuing, which I prooued to be vnderſtood by this word <hi>Bread,</hi> in reſpect of all the properties of <hi>Bread</hi> that are found therein. The worth of which bread hath beene declared vnto yee, as alſo what <hi>Saturity</hi> and true contentment is; and who they bee that labour, and come ſhort of it. I haue not beene trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150605:26"/>ſome to you, to inueigh againſt vanities, or loue of the world. Ye haue ſtore of bookes concerning that matter. I haue not declaimed of worldly contentments, how far they bee from true contentments; yea rather thornes,
<note place="margin">Mat. 13. Eccl. 1.</note> as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour calles them; or affliction of ſpirit as <hi>Salomon</hi> tearmes them. Euery ſermon yee heare is full of this Argument, whereunto I referre you. And therefore if yee ſhould like to loue them, or ſet your heart on them, beeing ſo baſe as they bee; in vaine yee haſten forward, that goe ſo cleane backward. In vaine yee flye vpward with ſo heauy a clogge at your heele; and in vain do I perſwade you to make haſte, that will not doe a way firſt, what will hinder you of your iourney? Haue ye riches? loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> looſely, &amp; part with them willingly, if neede bee. Haue yee pleaſures? vſe them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately in godly feare. Haue ye honour, and preheminence? keepe watch with your ſelues ouer pride, and diſdaine; and let all that know you, make account of you, that yee bee as humble, as honourable. And ſo, if yee can carry your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments in this ſort, as God bee the practicall ground, in whom alone is our true <hi>Satis,</hi> or contentment; then are yee vndoubtedly in your true, and perfect way to heauen, and nothing remaineth now, but that yee make haſte, and take comfort in it. Howbeit for that in our beſt actions, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours, that we haue in our way to God; our ſpirits bee often times dull, and haue neede of quickening:
<note place="margin">Sap. 9.</note> for as it is written, our body corruptible weigheth downe our ſoule, and hindreth haſte exceedingly. It ſhall be our next and laſt point, that I will entreate of; to ſay ſomewhat of the ioyes in heauen; that may waken vs when wee ſlumber, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member vs when wee forget; and ſpurre vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to amend our pace, when wee begin to ſtand ſtill. But this I will reſerue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till our next meeting. I will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you no further now.</p>

               <head>THE SECOND <hi>Oration.</hi> vpon Panis Angelorum.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Began the other day with <hi>Bread,</hi> and now I will end with <hi>Bread.</hi> I began with <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Trauellers.</hi> I will end with <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Angels.</hi> The beſt diſh, I haue reſerued for laſt; the bread the Angels feede on for euer. The other bread which wee haue ſpoken of, was a preparatiue for this bread, and this thereward of that: to ſet at board with angels, to eate angels meate.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 77.</note> Not the meate that was brought the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of angels, and periſhed; but that which angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues doe feede on, in ſight of their maker. And how farre better is this, then to ſit with <hi>Princes,</hi> or to be fellowes with <hi>Potentates?</hi> This is it muſt bee the reward of our Labours, this the <hi>Saturity,</hi> which nothing can be added vnto. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reward, that holy <hi>Moſes</hi> looked after, and now hath to his fill. As it is written, <hi>Moſes beheld his reward.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> His eye was ſtill vpon this reward, and ſo ouercame with eaſe the hardnes he ſuſtained vpon mountaines, and rocks, for forty yeares together; and what he endured in all his timethere, the tongue of man cannot expreſſe.</p>
               <p>Hee was one that walked perfectly in the wayes of God
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150605:28"/>alwayes, and therefore was wortthy to talke with God face to face. <hi>Mitisſimus ſuper terram:</hi> not a milder, or an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler that euer liued vpon earth. And yet the better to hold out through all afflictions to the end, <hi>aſpiciebat remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> hee was glad to looke at his reward; and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber often, what he ſhould haue for his paines in the end. <hi>S. Paul</hi> likewiſe had his eye that way,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> that he ſaid, that all wee can ſuffer in this world, cannot deſerue the glory, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends vs in the world to come. But how did <hi>Saint Paul;</hi> or how did <hi>Moſes</hi> know this? were they euer to ſee it? certaine it is, they had ſome illuſtrations more then other? becauſe their loue of God was greater, and their paines in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice much more then others.
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. Exod. 33.</note> The one was rauiſhed into the third heauens; the other ſaw the back-parts of God, as the Scriptures make mention. By which I inferre, if ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſparkes as theſe had neede of theſe comforts, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſometimes vpon their reward: How much more wee, that are of the latter brood, borne as it were in the wayne of the world, and comming ſhort a great deale of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and feruour; had we neede I ſay, to thinke one it often, and to beare continually the ioyes of heauen in our minde; yea, to keepe (if it might be) a true picture of them alwaies before our eyes, for feare of forgetting. For thus it is with vs. If we forget them, we are like to hazzard them, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them, they are like to be our owne.</p>
               <p>There be foure laſt things, that we are taught to beare in minde,
<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> and wee ſhall neuer ſinne; whereof heauen is the principall. Death, iudgement and hell are very needefull alſo to be thought of, becauſe it is good for vs to feare, aſwell as loue. Theſe indeede doe fill vs with feare and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; but heauen filles vs with loue and ardent deſire. Hell driues to God; heauen drawes to God. Hell whips vs with horror; heauen hales vs with beauty. Loue &amp; feare are both of them profitable I ſay, but loueis more acceptable to God, becauſe it is his owne prime, and originall quality, who drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nothing, and all things dread him.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth (my deare louers and friends) yee looke that I ſhould ſomewhat ſay of the ioyes of heanen, what they bee,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150605:28"/>and ſo it were fit, if I were able to performe it. But mee think when I enter into ſo great a matter, I am ſtricken on a ſuddaine with barrenneſſe, and know not how to expreſſe my ſelfe, or where to begin. For I muſt ſpeake of that, which I doe but wincke at a farre off, neither can I well tell, what credit I ſhall haue with you, to philoſophate vnto you of moſt excellent colours, which I neuer ſawe but darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For if <hi>S. Paul</hi> could not tell vs that little which he ſaw, nor yet <hi>Moſes;</hi> nor, if any other Saint haue beene there, and come againe to life, as <hi>S. Gregory</hi> writes of one <hi>Felix:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">in Dial.</note> much leſſe ſhall I be able, that neuer came neere that place, to delineate vnto yee any thing with my rude penſill,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> that ſhall bee worth your expectation. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> cals them <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana,</hi> hidden miſteries, that are kept vnder ſeale from vs, and ſuch as we may not aſpire to knowe, vntill we come there; and much leſſe to tell, no not with the tongue of an angell. The beſt that I can bring you, will bee but a reflexion of a reflexion, or a peece of the Sunnes glory by night in the body of the Moone. And yet ſince ye are come to heare, and I haue vndertaken to ſay ſomewhat, I will bee bold to ſay what I knowe, and no more; I leaue greater miſteries to them, that are better learned.</p>
               <p>Our reward in heauen (ſure) is admirably great: but what it is, or in what faſhion, that we may ſay it is thus and thus, no man can deliuer. Two things I knowe, and am aſſured of touching heauen, and heauenly ioyes; that is to ſay, the greatneſſe of them when we come there, and the neereneſſe of them while we bee heere: which may bee alſo no ſmall comfort vnto vs; and of theſe two I will ſpeake a little, after my wonted breuity, leauing the reſt to your good thoughts when I haue done. If your faith were like to his, that ſaid <hi>iuſtus ex fide viuit;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abac. 2. Rom. 2.</note> wee ſhould feele this greatnes we ſpeake of before we come at it; our very ſoule would reioyce, and triumph in it, before it could expreſſe why. If our faith I ſay were ſo liuely, and ſpringing as it might be, our tongues would not liſt to ſpeake, but our very deedes, actions, and behauiours, would ſhew heauen in our faces. Our very coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance would bewray heauen in vs. There is nothing would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150605:29"/>diſturbe vs, no anger diſquiet vs, no paſsion diſtemper vs, no ill fortune beare vs downe; but as we ſhall bee when wee come there, ſo ſhall we begin to bee, while we be heere, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſtout, reſolute in all good purpoſes like <hi>Elias</hi> or <hi>Elize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> or <hi>Saint Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and a multitude of others after the new teſtament. But I ſhall ſpeake more of this anon. Our faith and ſpirit is not of that <hi>viuacity,</hi> that theirs was of; nor haue we apprehenſions of heauens delights, but by ſuch <hi>ſimilies,</hi> and reſemblances, as we can make by viſible things; by which we haue a gheſſe, or eſtimate at the greatneſſe we ſpeake of, and yet come ſhort of it by infinite degrees.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell how to expreſſe this greatneſſe better then by one word; a long word full of matter, and makes vp a verſe alone. <hi>Incomprehenſibility</hi> the ſumme of our felicity. For we muſt know for a certainety, that the greatneſſe of our reward, that is to ſay, of heauen, is incomprehenſible of any mortall vnderſtanding. But why ſo? doe wee not reade of ſome that haue ſeene heauen, or paradiſe in a traunce, or extaſie, and comming to themſelues againe, haue told what they ſaw there? delicate green meddowes with ſiluer ſtreams and golden ſands in the bottome running through the midſt of them; the bankes beſet with violets, and primroſes, that neuer partch with heate, nor periſh with treading on; the weather temperate, alwayes <hi>Aprill</hi> with them.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Coole without cold, day without night,</l>
                  <l>Sunne full of ſhade, ſhade full of light.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Is not this comprehenſible? gardens full of all ſweeteflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, daintily dreſt without mans labour, the roſe without thornes neuer fading, pinckes and lillies of all freſh colours neuer decaying, ſpring and harueſt comming alwayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, blooming and bearing all at a time; nothing there but wiſh, and haue it, from the chirping bird of rareſt fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the lowde organ, or muſicke of the beſt harmony; theſe and ſuch like haue beene reuealed to ſome good folk. Are not theſe alſo comprehenſible? and yet we ſaid, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is incomprehenſible.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:150605:29"/>
               <p> We ſhall there behold the humanity of Chriſt &amp; his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mother the glorious Virgin, whom to ſee in fleſh, wee could trauell the world round, if they were liuing; ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort wee ſhould finde of it. For, if that notable Law-maker of <hi>Megapolis</hi> thought long to dye,
<note place="margin">Circidas.</note> and tooke pleaſure to thinke, he ſhould then ſee <hi>Pythagoras, Euclid,</hi> and other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous men deceaſed: how much more pleaſure will it be to vs, to ſee <hi>Ieſus,</hi> whom we all ſerue and honour: whoſe name alone makes hearts to leape, and diuells to tremble, in power ſo triumphant, ſo ſweet andamiable in aſpect, and ſo alluring to all beholders, that we ſhall not off on him, after wee come once to ſee him. And is not this comprehenſible?</p>
               <p>This heauen we ſpeake of was reuealed to S.
<note place="margin">Apoc. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> in forme of a city, twelue thouſand furlongs in length, as many in breadth, and as many in height, all the twelue gates of it, were entire pearle, the ſtreetes paued with gold, and the walles of the ſame pure gold, and ſmoothe like chriſtall: on the bottome whereof, grewe all kinde of pretious ſtones, whereof twelue are named. It had no temple; for the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was God himſelfe. Hee ſawe a Riuer alſo of liuing water, cleere as chriſtall, ſpringing out of the ſeate of God, and the lambe. This, and a great deale more he ſawe in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and is not all this comprehenſible?</p>
               <p>I gaue you the other day fiue properties of bread. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I tolde you nothing aboue your reach, but yee might plainly vnderſtand them to bee in our bread of Trauellers. And I can make it as plaine to you, how they bee alſo as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, and farre more certaine in our bread of Angels. The ſubſtance of our trauelling bread was the grace of God in word, and workes: The ſubſtance of our Angelicall bread is his grace alſo, not in faith, but in fruite; not in workes, but in reward. His grace is with vs heere but in hope, there, in certaine knowledge; heere in trembling, there in true poſſeſsing. Heere wee may fall againe, there, neuer. This grace of God in heauen, ſhall bee his eye of glory vpon vs alwaies. The maſters eye makes a fat beaſt, and the eye of God vpon vs inceſſantly, makes faire creatures, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to Angels. And this was the firſt propertie to feede
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150605:30"/>vs, and nouriſh vs, <hi>Quipaſcit inter lillia,</hi> He ſhall feede vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Lillies and Angels.</p>
               <p>The ſecond property was to make pureſt blood in vs. We ſhall not looke like our earthly complexions. No groſſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours or droſſe ſhall approch vs. How pure ſhall wee be? As pure as Angels. Our bodies like glaſſe tranſpârent, <hi>Sine macula aut ruga,</hi> All manner of ſpots will bee taken out of vs, and euery wrinckle made plaine. A third quality of bread was to be loued of all. And who ſhall behold that ſparkling eye of God, and ſhall not be enamoured with it? <hi>Vulneraſti cor meum in vno oculorum tuorum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 4.</note> Our hearts will bee woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with that alluring eye. It ſhall not bee like our loues heere, which are more in clayming, then in obtaining, and after a while wee care not for them. Beleeue me: not ſo in heauen. And all this is comprehenſible.</p>
               <p>Now what ſhould I ſpeake how common this bread is in heauen, which was the fourth property? This bread of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphins, ô how eaſily it is gotten, and without asking? Common I ſay, for euery one ſhall haue enough. Neither ſhall the commonneſſe, or hauing without asking make the reward more vile. For euery one ſhall reioyce that another hath the ſame, or more then he. The fore-finger is graced with that the little finger weares.</p>
               <p>I keepe ſtill within compaſſe of your capacity. And to omit the fift property, which is not in heauen, where none can euer be at loſſe, or fall from good eſtate: I paſſe to a ſixt property, which is in our Angels bread, and was not in the other. There is no doubt, but we ſhall haue our taſte in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as other our ſences, but in greater vſe and perfection. And if we could make a peece of bread to taſte in our mouth of what wee liſt, like a peare, or pearmaine, a cherry, a plumbe, or a peece of marmalet, wee would thinke it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing. Behold, our Angels bread taſtes of God; and in God is euery good taſte. No amber or ciuet ſo ſweete as hee, no conſerue ſo preſeruatiue, no codinik ſo delectable. Is not all this alſo comprehenſible? How is it then that we ſay, heauen is incomprehenſible?</p>
               <p>And yet we muſt make our ſaying good, that it is indeed incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150605:30"/>All our amplifying is nothing <hi>abſque eo,
<note place="margin">Cant. 4.</note> quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecus latet,</hi> All is nothing to that which is hidden, as the louer ſaid of his loue in the Canticles. It is hidden from vs moſt, that ſhall delight vs moſt. Fewe of all theſe are there, that I haue ſpoken of. Buildings, and walles of gold, no ſuch thing there; no greene meddowes, or ſiluer ſtreames; no muſicke, or melody, ſuch as euer we heard, or knew. All theſe bee baſe, to that wee ſhall finde there. And yet our ſences heere attaining no higher matter of pleaſure: theſe things are ſaid to bee there, that wee moſt deſire, and haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt luſter heere. And which if wee finde not there, in theſe kinds, yet are we not deceiued; becauſe we ſhall finde them there in another kind wee know not of, fiue hundred times better, and without all compariſon greater.</p>
               <p>And this doe they that bee learned call <hi>Theologiam nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuam.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Grana. de Symb.</note> Becauſe all that we can ſay heere of heauen and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things in the affirmatiue, wee may boldly deny and ſay, there is no ſuch thing there. For our bodies it is cleere, wee ſhall be bright, quicke, nimble, ſubtill, full of noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſuch as we can aske no more. But for things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vs, how wee ſhall finde them, no man can iuſtly ſay. No ſuch light as wee apprehend, no ſuch mirth or feaſting, no pearle or pretious gemes there; no palace of pleaſure with Bricks or pauements of gold; no ſuch odours for the ſmell, or dainty notes to our eare; or guſtfull things to our pallat, as wee haue them heere. But on the contrary; if we ſay what is nôt there, that is euill and troubleſome heere: all that we may boldly ſay to be literally true. No afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there, no feare of any thing, no ſorrow or lamentation, no weeping or wayling, nor any thing that can grieue. This fleſh of ours ſhall not bee heauy, lumpiſh, or drowſie, mortall, paſsible, corruptible, or ſubiect to torment, not ſo much as to a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-ake. All this wee are ſure ſhall nôt be, and wee ſhall nôt haue; but what elſe wee ſhall finde there, or what heauen is in the affirmatiue, it is wholly concealed from vs, vntill wee come there. And therefore, as to our preſent knowledge, and to our now capacity; if wee ſhould take vpon vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, or deſcribe heauen what it is, I know not how to doe it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150605:31"/>then to ſay thus: Heauen is that which it is nôt; and it is nôt that, which it is.</p>
               <p>And with this agreeth a ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer wee ſay or affirme of heauen out of the Scriptures, fathers, reuelations, or viſions that good people haue had, and I ſhould ſtand to recite heere till night: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he tels vs abſolutely, <hi>In cor hominis non aſcendit,</hi> It neuer came vp into our heart, and much leſſe into our tongue, to thinke or ſay, what it is. And to ſay the truth, it were a great imperfection in heauens perfection, that it ſhould be like any thing heere, or we in our mortality cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of any thing there: more then this in generall, that it is a viſion of God, and that wee ſhall bee ſo delighted with this heauenly, and blisfull gaze when wee come there, that when wee haue beheld him inceſſantly as many thouſand yeares, as there be minutes of howres in a thouſand yeares; hee will ſtill bee as new to vs, as if wee had neuer ſeene him before; and wee ſtill more thirſty after his diuine contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, then euer wee were of drinke after a hot daies iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Howbeit to ſay now what this felicity is, or rather in what ſort we ſhall apprehend God, or in what part, or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of vs this feeling pleaſure ſhall conſiſt, when wee come to ſee Chriſt, and glorified friends, we neither know, nor can know heere.</p>
               <p>No doubt, the apprehenſion wee ſhall haue of him, ſhall bee in our vnderſtanding ſoule. But whether in ſuch ſort, as it is in other knowledges, or whether the difference will be <hi>Specificall</hi> or no, I know not. Wee heare of many delicate fruites in ſtrange countries, apples, peares, or plumbes, of moſt excellent taſte, and verdure. The outſides are deſcribed to vs, both for colour, ſhape, and bigneſſe. But none can tell vs the ſweeteneſſe, or delightfull reliſh of them within, vntill wee taſte. Onely this we know, that our ſenſe can iudge of them when we haue them; and we ſhall neede no new addition to our ſenſes perfection to taſte them. But when wee come to ſo infinite an obiect as God is; ſhall we not neede a new vnderſtanding thinke yee?

               <p>There is no contentment in this world, but if it come to affect vs, and to poſſeſſe our heart, it aſcends to our heart, and comes from belowe our heart; it comes from vnder vs, and for the moſt part, from vnder our very feete. We tread on them, and they are all vnder vs. Great lands and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions, faire houſes, parkes, and pallaces; they come all from vnder vs, and were earth, and clay firſt, before they came to this magnificence. Their furniture of ſilke arraſſe, and beddes of gold; all that we carry on our backs, or decke our heads, or necks withall when we be at the richeſt with ſtone, and pearle, and coffers full of treaſure, that are made ſo much of; whence comes all this, but out of barren earth, or the bottome of the ſea, ſought for, and tumbled out by the toyle of man from the bowels of the earth, that are ſo farre beneath vs. Againe, if our contentment bee in belly cheere, all comes likewiſe from the loweſt elements. Nothing lower then the earth, and water, which they feede on, before they come to feede vs. And therefore if they come ſo neere our heart, as to be loued by vs; we loue that which is lower, and baſer then our ſelues, and they muſt aſcend a great height vnto vs, to be as high as our hearts.</p>
               <p>Yea let vs goe to higher elements and ſo vpward to the toppe of <hi>primum mobile;</hi> let them be neuer ſo high aboue yet are they vnder vs by Gods ordination, who made them, to ſerue vs. And if we delight in them, &amp; in the ſtudy of them as to contemplate their motions, and iufluences, and all their varieties, that are moſt pleaſant to think on, and haue holden Philoſophers all their liues time: all theſe may bee ſaid, and are in the number of thoſe that aſcend to vs; our heart, and beſt part being Lord of them, and they our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and inferiours. The conſideration of ſtarres, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150605:32"/>with their brightneſſe, and beauty, pure ſubſtance, and greatneſſe, and the orbes they are carried in, the ſwiftnes of their motion without noyſe, their change without diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, their various aſpects without confuſion; all theſe and a great deale more come vnder the heart of man; &amp; though they appeare much higher then wee, that goe lowe by the grounde vnderneath them; yet may they truely bee ſaide to aſcend to vs: yea all that God made in his ſixe dayes worke, be they neuer ſo rich, or excellent, neuer ſo high in their ſituation, yet are they beneath the ſoule, or thought of man, and are homagers to this little world of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and they cannot be ſo great, but our thought is greater, they cannot be ſo high, or tall, but our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding will compaſſe them, and is higher and taller then they. Onely the ioyes of heauen are higher then our apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, they aſcend not into our thought, or heart, as all things elſe doe, becauſe we are made to aſcend to them, and vntill then, wee are not capeable of them, no not of the leaſt of them.</p>
               <p>Behold here the greatneſſe of heauenly rewards, our heart, and minde, our ſoule, and vnderſtanding, that is cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of all things, that are in the world; and all things aſcend to it, as to their commander; yet knoweth it not the leaſt thing in heauen, as it is indeede. The witte of man doth pierce the moſt hidden and abſtruſe things that are in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and yet cannot faſten vpon the leaſt, and loweſt things aboue nature. It is a wonderfull thing, that there is almoſt nothing, that eſcapeth our knowledge, but is laid open by vs, &amp; we can teach it them, that know it not. Who was there euer that went down to the center of the earth to take mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it; and yet wee can prooue by iuſt demonſtration, how many mile it is thither, and how many about the whole earth, and neuer ſtirre foote? Who was euer carryed ſo high as the Moone? who hath walked among the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and firmament, to know their motions and diſtances one from another, the bigneſſe of the Sunne and Moone; and their heights from the earth? yet all this is knowne, and the profeſſors of that ſcience are ſo well acquainted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150605:33"/>with the lawes, and rules of that <hi>Celestiall</hi> common-wealth, as if they bad beene borne and bredde there. Their yearely <hi>Ephimerides</hi> doe ſhew the certainety of their knowledge pointing vs to the very degree, and minute, where to finde a ſtarre, or what time of day, or night an Ecclips will be, and how many points it will be darkened an hundred yeares hence.</p>
               <p>It is not vnknowne to any, what a multitude of hidden matters are reuealed, and lye open to the Philoſopher, and what an Anatomy hee hath made of nature, and naturall things. And not ſo contented, hath tranſcended nature, with his <hi>metaphiſicall</hi> knowledge, and lets not God himſelfe lye wholly hidden, but brings him out into light. Who taught <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> that God was eternall, infinite of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, infinite in power, the firſt moouer, one, and no more but one? But it is not my purpoſe to ſpeake of all ſciences that haue beene laboured, and perfected, by man, euery one of them ſo full of miſtery, variety, and delight, as nothing more. Which although it greatly commend Gods goodnes and bounty towards vs, in that hee hath made out of duſt, and aſhes a creature ſo capeable, and piercing by his owne permiſsion euen into his owne ſubſtance and nature: yet ſo hath he limited this knowledge of ours, that we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to imagine what he is indeede <hi>Sicuti eſt,</hi> nor how great the meaneſt thing that belongs to vs, and ſhall be ours in the world to come, if God makes vs worthy. We haue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not ſeene or heard, but neither can we gheſſe in thought, <hi>in cor hominis non aſcendit,</hi> what it is.</p>
               <p>If the leaſt thing then in heauen be ſo great, what is all heauen? what is God, who is the ſumme and ſubſtance of all reward, and felicitie? We that be Chriſtians, haue much more knowledge then heathens had. Our light of reaſon is doubled with our light of faith annexed therunto; by which wee both ſee more then we ſee with our eye; &amp; what we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, we beleeue more, then had we ſeen with eie. What ſeek wee more? We beleeue that heauen is truely great, and our reward vnſpeakeably great. What ſeeke we further into the ſecrets of God, to know how? Let vs not be curious in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150605:33"/>matters not belonging to vs yet. Let vs not deſtroy faith with too much curioſitie? If God would condeſcend to giue vs a ſight of heauen, and of our glory there, we ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuſe it with humilitie, then expect it with importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <q>Wee ſhould rather ſay to him, <hi>Satis domine;</hi> thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is aſmuch to me Lord, as if I were there to ſee it. It is enough to me, that I knowe it is ſo. O let me not ſee, vntill it pleaſe thee to call.</q> This ſhould be our ſpeech to God; and much heede wee ought to take, that we diminiſh not his faith with leaſt doubt of his promiſe, or deſire to haue it prooued by ſence. Sence knowledge, derogats from faith knowledge. If we ſee it once, it is faith no more. And wee may offend in it ere wee bee aware. For hee that ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth into Maieſtie, ſhall bee ouercome of glory.
<note place="margin">Prou. 25.</note> As much to ſay, as he that will enter into Gods counſell before hee be called; ſhall be puniſhed as <hi>Phaeton</hi> was; his owne pride will ouerthrowe him. This alone may ſuffice for the greatneſſe of our reward; yee apprehend it with faith, and that is enough, yea a great deale more, then any eloquence in the world can paint vnto you.</p>
               <p>I omit therefore to ſpeake of many things beſides that would expreſſe this greatneſſe. As alſo of the many names, whereby it is called in holy writ, and ancient fathers: which would greatly teſtifie the greatneſſe of it. As where it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mons pacis,</hi> the Mountaine of peace, where no diſquiet or brabble can reach at vs; and that which <hi>Princes</hi> haue much adoe to performe with all their power and policie, is there done with eaſe. No warre or diſſentation can approach this hill, where hearts and mindes are all one; one will in all, and there is not found a ſecond. It is called <hi>Domus dei,</hi>

In heauen quite contrary. It is no diſgrace to a king to haue many fellowes. Yea Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues reioyce exceedingly, and Chriſt our Lord diſdaineth not to ſet vs by him,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.</note> and to communicate his crowne with vs. Saint <hi>Paules</hi> word is <hi>conregnabimus,</hi> We ſhall bee fellow kings with him; this were treaſon heere.</p>
               <p>But wee muſt knowe, that by this word king are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood two great titles. The one of neceſsity; the other of honour: the one a title of paine, and charge, begotten of common good, for preſeruing of peace, and iuſtice among men; the other a title of honour, and greatneſſe, deſerued by themſelues, or their anceſtours, or both. In the right of the one,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. Apoc. 20.19. ibid. 44.</note> he carrieth a ſword <hi>ad vindictam;</hi> in right of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he weareth a Crowne on his head as a conquerour. The one needleſſe in heauen, where all be good; the other needfull
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150605:34"/>in heauen to deſpite the diuell, and them that be bad. And this kingly honour, no king hath more on earth, then ſoules haue in heauen;
<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.</note> who acknowledge no ſuperiour there but God, as kings doe heere. Onely, their crownes differ, the one is of gold, the other is of glory; they differ alſo not a little in there eſtates, the one is for life, the other for euer.</p>
               <p>And therefore in our creede it is called by another name, <hi>Vita aeterna,</hi> or life euerlaſting. Our eſtate in our kingdome there, is for life, but wee ſhall liue for euer. How farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this then your fee ſimple heere, which yee ſay, yee haue for euer, yet cannot haue longer then for life, nor ſo long neither many times. And if they that follow you waſte it, where is your fee ſimple. It may rightly bee called fee ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a ſimple for euer. But ours not ſo; it will bee for euer; which no violence can wreſt from vs, no ruſt or moth weare away, no time nor oldeneſſe wrinkle or disfigure, no ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe conſume, no wrong hazzard, or miſinformation call in queſtion. Our eſtate there pure, perfect, and indefeazable, tyed to no condition, charged with no incumbrance, or feare of forfeiture. Subiect to no law like a king; no mans vaſſall, and doing no mans will, but our owne, and ours none of our owne, but Gods.</p>
               <p>What an inexplicable greatneſſe is this? and yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not leaue it ſo: the more I haue ſaid, the more me thinke I haue to ſay. But I will bound my ſelfe to one or two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations more, and ſo ende for this point. I may not forget to tell you the price of heauen, and ſcarcity of buyers, that will giue any thing neere the worth of it. Both which but briefly conſidered will not a little aduance the greatneſſe we haue in hand. By the price, that is giuen for a commodity, wee may gheſſe at the worth of it. If a thouſand pound bee giuen for a purchaſe, wee eſteeme it at fifty a yeare. If a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be giuen we eſteeme it at fifty thouſand a yeare. The price of heauen is ſet downe by a cunning ſuruey or of thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Tantum valet, quantum es</hi> ſaith he. It is as much worth, as thy ſelfe: that is to ſay, all that thou haſt, and art. And ſo is it prized by the Sonne of God;
<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> who likened heauen to a pretious pearle, which a certaine
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150605:35"/>Ieweller finding, <hi>Vendidit omnia ſua, &amp; comparauit eam,</hi> hee ſould all that hee had to buy it. Becauſe it was worth all he had, he ſolde all, and bought it. Of all iewels there is none more excellent then an orient pearle.
<note place="margin">Lib. 9. cap. 35.</note> It is <hi>culmen omnium preſiotiorum</hi> (ſaith <hi>Plinie</hi>) nothing more pretious then it. Both is it hardeſt to counterfeit; and there is nothing dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or higher prized then it. The <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> had one giuen her at <hi>Florence</hi> was valued by good Lapidaries at thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand pounds ſterling. <hi>Ferdinand Cortes</hi> that conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Mexico,</hi> had one at his eare valued at all the king of Spaines treaſure, that had euer come from the <hi>Jndies</hi> to that time. Which exceeded far the price of any <hi>Diamond</hi> that euer I heard of.</p>
               <p>Now if I ſhould ſay, that this were the price of heauen; I ſhould come ſhort of it by farre. For the price of the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt life is more then this. <hi>Cuncta quae habet homo, dabit pro anima ſua,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 2.</note> A man will giue all hee hath for his life. Yet how many liues haue bin giuen, or ioyfully loſt for this heauenly pearle by holy Martyrs? Is not this an admirable greatnes, that ſhould be worth a mans life, euen a kings life and all his kingdome, if he be a king? For by this text, a life compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all. Yet all this is litle to that. I can ſay no more. What if I can prooue it to be worth the life of God himſelfe? yea, what ſhould I neede to prooue ſo manifeſt a truth, which all wee that bee Chriſtians are bound to beleeue? I would wee could as ſenſibly feele it, as we truely conceit it. The life of God himſelfe was giuen for it. <hi>Adam</hi> once had morgaged it, and made a forfeit of it, and our heauenly father ſent downe a price for it, his onely Sonne to redeeme it. Ye are redeemed (ſaith Saint <hi>Peter</hi>) not with corruptible gold,
<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> or corruptible ſiluer, but with the pretious blood of the imaculate lambe. And this is <hi>praetium magnum</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul).</hi> And well might hee call it a great price;
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> for it is an infinite price: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I inferre thus. To recouer our loſt inheritance coſt an infinite price; but an infinite price muſt bee for an infinite greatnes, therefore our inheritance muſt be of infinite great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; then which, what is or can be greater.</p>
               <p>And if this be not enough to ſtir your affections towards
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150605:35"/>it, or to poſſeſſe you thoroughly of this greatneſſe by the greatneſſe of the price, that hath beene giuen for it: Rayſe your imagination a little, and thinke with your ſelues; that yee ſee God in fleſh. Thinke that his noble preſence were in the middeſt of you. Beholde his perſon, beholde his face, and yee ſhall ſee the greatnes of heauen in it. In a little round glaſſe, ye may ſee the firmament aboue yee; and in the compaſſe of his face yee may ſee whole heauen. That ouerioyed face, with ſeeing heauens beauty; that euer ſorrowed face, that his fleſh might not come there yet.
<note place="margin">Luc 12.</note> I am grieued ſaith he, till it come to paſſe. That auerted face from all worldly contentment; that ſcornefull face to all earthly promotion, which he neither had time to thinke on, nor yet thought worth his care, in reſpect of that greatneſſe, that was alwayes glittering in his eye.</p>
               <p>Gold to him ſhewed no brighter then Counters, hee would not touch it. Plenty with him no greater then the poore mans boxe; more then that, was diſtaſtfull. Pleaſures to him no ſweeter then blowes; nothing could drawe his eye from the Radient ſplendor aboue him.
<note place="margin">Prou. 8.</note> All his riches was in that ſacred eye of his.

               <p>But now I feare me I muſt change my ſong to ſpeake of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150605:36"/>the laſt point; which is the fewneſſe of Buyers. I began with a <hi>Comedy</hi> and muſt end with a <hi>Tragedie.</hi> But I will be the ſhorter.

Hardly one of the twentie or rather of fortie thouſand that ſhall be ſaued throughout the world. I thinke before Chriſt came, ſcarce one of a Million.

               <p>God died for all: but none haue the benefit of it, but his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle brood of the elect: &amp; theſe were <hi>Jſraelites,</hi> and Iewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the incarnation, &amp; Chriſtians ſince the incarnation.

Heauen is not for Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or cold friends.

Striue yee to enter the ſtreight gate. And euen ſo hath it prooued in all ages. They that were good, were alwayes fewe. In all the olde world,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> eight perſous onely were ſaued, the reſt were drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. What numbers haue there beene of heretiques, and yet are, that haue no part in the kingdome of heauen? and of thoſe that beleeue well, how many bee there that liue well? who delights in Gods ſeruice, or holds himſelfe to howers, and orderly life? who is there almoſt, that hath not one fault, to bring him to hell; and yet will not leaue it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it leaue him? how many more be there that haue many faults, giue way to them all, ſwallow all, till all too late they repent them. The broad way they be in, they like well to go forward in, loue eaſe, loue ſecurity, neuer ſeeke more, and ſo dodge on till they die, and dye as they liued.</p>
               <p>Very fewe there be indeede, and too too few that be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. Many runne in the furlong (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) yet but one gets the prize.
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> And why but one amongſt many? hee inſinuates a reaſon a little after, that no man may-deſpaire notwithſtanding, to get the gole if he will. His reaſon is for that ſcarce one amongſt many prepareth for the race, as he ſhould. <q>They be commonly ſo ſloathfull, and drowſie, that they dyet not themſelues, they deny not their belly all exceſſe, inure not their ſoules to daily practiſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in that heaueuly race;</q> ſo as they runne, but vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, and as it were beating the ayre. All follow vanities, the proiects of their owne hearts, and no man ponders, or conſiders deepely the greatneſſe of this heauenly gole hee runnes for, and therefore looſeth it.</p>
               <p>Alas we cannot get trifles in the world without care. Yea all the care we can, we beſtowe vpon them commonly. But no man beſtowes on heauen the leaſt care, come of it, what will. It is an ill dogge they ſay, that is not worth whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The moſt make worſe then a dogge of heauenly feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150605:37"/>They hardly beſtowe a ſigh on it from their heart in a long time. But it is not my purpoſe to ſhew reaſons why it is ſo, that ſo few be ſaued. It is enough that wee haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it to bee ſo, euen amongſt the profeſſors of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. O greatnes of heauenly reward. Who ſhall attaine thy holy hill? Who ſhall be admitted to ſit with Angels? <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne paerclarum rarum,</hi> Euery thing that is excellent in this world, is alſo rare. If kings were common, and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons euery where, who could ſee their greatneſſe? Euen ſo it is of good folke, who are as admirable as rare, whatſoeuer men thinke of them. O happy lot, ô excellent reward. Thy excellency is ſeene by thy rareneſſe, and hard to come by. O worthy of worthies, that the world ſets ſo little by, and is not worthy of. How great art thou in thy height? How great in breadth, and largeneſſe? Thou art big in place, ſpacious in thy roomes, large in thy beautifull territories. The earth is little to thee. Hell is nothing to thee. Behold heere an admirable worke of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heauen</hi> is aboue, neere God. <hi>Hell</hi> belowe neere the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as is thought where moſt bee, the place is narroweſt to receiue them: where feweſt Soules bee, there is roome to ſpare. The number of damned ſoules is without number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thoſe in <hi>Heauen;</hi> and yet their place is infinitely leſſe then it in heauen. The way to hell is broad and wide, but narrowe and pinching when one comes there, eſpecially when they come to their bodies againe. Moſt woefull it is to thinke on, how they will lye thronging and crowding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for want of roome, like bricks, or tyles in a burning kill, not able or not allowed to ſtirre hand or foote, if they would neuer ſo faine, men and women, fatte and leane, little and great, hudling one vpon another confuſedly, without reſpect of age or ſexe, or any bodies ranke or place, which they had in this world: with <hi>Heauen</hi> all contrary. The way thither narrow, and ſtreight, and hard to paſſe it; but when one is there, and hath crowded through the little wicket; he findes a large field, and goes freely where hee will, without end or wearineſſe.</p>
               <p>The nature of contraries is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary qualities; hell is litle
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150605:38"/>in eaſe, becauſe, there is no eaſe; little in pleaſure, becauſe it is all in diſpleaſure; little in roome, becauſe it hath no roome for any repoſe. <hi>Heauen</hi> therefore muſt needs be great, faire, goodly, bright, beautifull, full of eaſe, full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, euery body would haue; few will take paines for; and therefore thouſands to one, ſhall not haue it, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I doubt not but all men beleeue as much as I; or any man can ſay of this <hi>Angelicall</hi> ſubiect. And I doubt as little, but they thinke it well worthy of their ſtudie and care, and of their paines and coſt, if coſt bee needfull for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it. But what is the paines that belongs to it, that men, and women ſo ſhrinke at, and pull in their necks? Is it loſſe of life, or limme? Not ſo, but in caſe of Martyrdome. Is it to giue all to the poore?
<note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> Not ſo; though <hi>Christ</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe it one, that ſought to be perfect. Is it to ſuffer burning, or paines of hell for it before wee come there? Not ſo, and yet Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> wiſheth it with all his heart,
<note place="margin">Medit.</note> that hee might feelehell torments a good while together, to bee ſure to come thither; and ſo doth venerable <hi>Bede.</hi> See what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion theſe had of <hi>Heauens greatneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is then the let that ſtoppes them? What the paine that terrifies?
<note place="margin">Prou. 26.</note> What Lyon in the way, that puttes men out of the way? What ſpirit or hobgoblin skares them ſo, that they runne quite contrary, and ſcarce looke backe againe? Surely, nothing elſe in the world, but a loathing, or wearineſſe of well doing. They thinke the paine nothing, if it were ſhort, but to perſeuere long in good courſes they hold it a cruell thing. They ſay in their hearts, they could endure much for a day, or an hower, ſo <hi>Heauen</hi> would come preſently, without tarrying too long for it. But to liue a long life, and all the while in Battell, all the while in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding temptations, and allurements, and denying their owne willes; all the while expecting reward, and none com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; it is more then fleſh and blood can beare, and they will not endure it. But how Daſtardly a thought is this? How erronious, and wide from the matter? That which they thinke ſo hard, is with practiſe eaſie. And that which they thinke is far off, is rather neere, as I ſhall prooue
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150605:38"/>vnto you now. I haue ſpoken hitherto of <hi>Reward,</hi> how great it will bee when wee ſhall haue it. Now hearken I beſeech you for the <hi>Neereneſſe</hi> alſo a word or two, according to my promiſe, and then I ſhall conclude.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Sauiour</hi> well foreſaw this weakeneſſe of ours, how weary wee would bee of well doing, if hee were not at hand to vs with <hi>Reward,</hi> he knew our proneneſſe to euill, and how ſoone wee were like to diſtaſt, and forgoe this <hi>Bread of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers,</hi> if wee ſhould ſtay too long for our <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Angels.</hi> And therefore, before hee manifeſted himſelfe to the world, he ſent vs word by his fore-runner, and the firſt words his <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſpake next to <hi>Penetentiam agite,</hi> were theſe:
<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>appropin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quauit enim regnum caelorum,</hi> The kingdome of <hi>Heauen</hi> is at hand. A noble comfort, if wee haue faith to beleeue.
<note place="margin">Abac. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens veniet &amp; non tardabit</hi> ſaith another Prophet, Comming hee will come, and make no delay. And in another place, <hi>Ecce venio citò, &amp; merces mea mecum eſt,</hi> Beholde I come quickly, and my reward in my hand. Hee doth as mothers doe by their children, promiſe them to come quickly, that they may not thinke long; ſo heere, <hi>venio citò:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 3. ibid. 22.</note> mothers ſpeake it ſometimes in pollicy, but God ſaith it truely (as wee ſhall finde it) <hi>venio citò,</hi> I come preſently. <hi>Non tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat Deus promiſſionem ſuam</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.</note> God is not ſlowe in rewarding vs; how can wee ſay then that hee tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth long, hee is farre off from vs, and ſcarcely thinkes on vs?</p>
               <p>It is a ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, not to beleeue the Holy Ghoſt. And if wee will beleeue nothing but reaſon, very ſence and reaſon will tell vs as much. For it cannot be very farre off, that, wee feare rather is too neere. Who is there, that thinkes not or feares not, that death is too neere? for ſo ſaid the <hi>Epicure: Cras moriemur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 22.</note> Wee ſhall dye to morrow. And thus ſay they that would liue ſtill, and take their pleaſure, they are alwayes phyſicking, and guarding themſelues againſt death, which they feare ſtill is too neere. If death then bee neere, how is it that <hi>Heauen</hi> is not neere, which wee cannot haue, vntill wee dye? Why complaine wee; that <hi>Heauen</hi> is farre off, when the doore of <hi>Heauen</hi> is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150605:39"/>too neere? Some anſwer againe, that death is too neere indeede, but it is alwaies in reſpect of our vnreadineſſe to dye onely. Well then, death and <hi>Heauen</hi> are neere. But it is wee that are farre off. Why ſay we then that <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi> is farre off, when it is our ſelues are farre off with our vnreadineſſe, not <hi>Heauen</hi> farre off with our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Indeede it is true, if <hi>Heauen</hi> bee neere, and we runne from it, wee ſhall neuer come at it: and then no fault in <hi>Heauens</hi> neereneſſe; but in our farreneſſe. Where otherwiſe if death bee neere, <hi>Heauen</hi> muſt needes bee neere to them that ſhall haue it. Mee thinkes, this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould conuince them. For if death bee neere in our feare, why ſhould it not bee as neere in our hope? Wee confeſſe the one; therefore wee muſt confeſſe the other.</p>
               <p>And yet I cannot deny but the Saints alſo in ſome ſence doe thinke it farre off, and ſhew ſome tokens of wearineſſe. But this is doubtleſſe out of a true longing after <hi>heauen,</hi> not out of a feare, that they ſhall ſtaye too long for it; out of wearineſſe they haue of the world, not out of wearineſſe of waiting and attending Gods pleaſure; out of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and vnworthineſſe to come thither yet; not out of floath or preſumption that it is time enough yet: out of a thirſt they haue after God, whoſe face the <hi>Angels</hi> feede on; not out of temptation, and weakeneſſe as we doe, who, if our ſence be not pleaſed, wee bidde the ſpirit adeiw. In the one ſence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7. Pſal. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>Who</hi> ſhalldeliuer me from this body of death; and holy <hi>Dauid,</hi> When ſhall I come and appeare before the face of my God? And in another place, <hi>Woe</hi> is mee that my habitation is prolonged,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> thinking eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minute an hower, and euery day a yeare, vntill they were diſſolued,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1. Pſal. 13.</note> and were with <hi>Chriſt:</hi> in the other ſence, <hi>Dixit inſipiens in corde ſuo,</hi> The foole ſaid in his heart, there is no God. Or if hee ſaid it not, yet his actions ſay that, when he beleeues not Gods promiſes, but makes him a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician, to tell vs he is at hand, when we haue twenty, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or forty yeares yet to liue, as many haue. No, no, hee deales not politikely, but faithfully with vs; and if wee ſee
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150605:39"/>not his words to be true in this, we are blinde, and ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Holy <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith the <hi>daies</hi> of man are threeſcore and ten yeares, theſe ſeeme great to children; but to our firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the old teſtament this was no age. And if we ſhould now liue ordinarily ſo long, wee might haply haue ſome excuſe for our wearineſſe. But alas, what are theſe three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and tenne yeares? They are nothing to ſpeake of, and ſo runne out. They that haue them thinke them quickely gone. Wee heare olde folkes confeſſe it, and why ſhould wee not beleeue them, when they ſay as they finde? we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the <hi>Sentinell,</hi> what he ſees from a high tower, becauſe he is higher then we; and we beleeue the ſea-man what he diſcouers from aboue the toppe-ſaile, ſeeing farther then we. So ought wee beleeue our elders, and ancients, when they ſpeake what they haue prooued, and wee ſhall ſay the ſame, when we come to the ſame yeares. And they ſay no more, but what our <hi>Patriarke Iacob</hi> ſaid: <hi>the daies</hi> of my pilgrimage (ſaid he) are an hundred and thirtie;
<note place="margin">Gen. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>little</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</hi> Holy <hi>Job,</hi> ſaid <hi>breues dies hominis ſunt,</hi> our dayes are but ſhort. And he asketh a queſtion thus:
<note place="margin">Iob 14.</note> 
                  <hi>nunquid non paucitas dierum meorum finietur breui,</hi> Will not the fewneſſe of my daies be ſoone ended? Marke theſe words fewneſſe; and ſoone ended; and yet he had an hundred and forty yeares to liue after; and when hee ſpake it, hee was in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame paine, when euery hower might ſeeme a day to him.</p>
               <p>Theſe men I hope will be beleeued what they ſay. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare now the Prophet <hi>Dauids</hi> ſayings to theſe: both ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from one ſpirit of truth. Holy <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> ſay, the daies of man are ſhort. Holy <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith our <hi>yeares</hi> are threeſcore and tenne; therefore (I ſay) the time of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten are ſhort, and quickely gone, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our reward at hand. How will this argument bee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? one telsvs, that all the earth as bigge as it is, and full of great kingdomes is no bigger then a pinnes head in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to the vaſt and huge firmament; and we eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, when the learned tell vs it, though our ſence doth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150605:40"/>not reach it. And yet how little, or nothing, our pilgrimage is heere, euen his that liueth longeſt; a matter of ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience, and which our owne infirmities, and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indiſpoſitions minde vs of; we perſwade our ſelues not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that it is a long time, and neither will autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, reaſon, or warning by others, once mooue vs, or beate vs from this moth-eaten hold we haue of long life forſooth, and time enough yet. Three or fourſcore yeares are a long time with vs in Gods ſeruice; though ſhort enough in our deſires.</p>
               <p>But let them be as long as men will haue them. Suppoſe threeſcore and tenne be great, and grieuous to holde out to the end withall in vertuous life. See whether God in this alſo, haue not done very much for vs, that we may haue no cauſe to alleadge againſt him, if we will make benefit of it. How many be there I pray, that liue to threeſcore and tenne. Doth euery man liue, till he be old? I will ſaymore. Doth euery one liue to halfe thoſe yeares? I will be bolde to ſay; and I thinke I can prooue it, that halfe thove that are borne into the world, doe neuer come to fiue and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yea more then this; hardly two parts of three, come to ſee fiue and thirty. And this I prooue two waies. Firſt by the many multitudes of them that dye betweene the cradle, and fiue and thirty. As appeareth by ſextons and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarkes, whom I haue heard affirme, that they bury two of the yonger halfe which are vnder fiue &amp; thirty, for one of the elder halfe, from thirty fiue to ſeuenty. Secondly &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, by a ſuruey of houſholds, families, and towne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippes throughout the land, be it in citty, towne, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that in this manner. Deuide any of theſe into three; and ſcarce the third part is fiue and thirty. My ſelfe haue noted that two parts of three, are alwaies vnder fiue and thirty. Vnleſſe it be in princes houſes, and hoſpitals. If the family be nine perſons, ſixe of them be vnder; if fifteene, tenne of them be vnder; If there be thirty in a houſe, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the leaſt are vnder; and ſo forward in proportion. Ye will ſay this may be true; not becauſe they bee dead, that ſhould make vp the number euen; but becauſe they marry
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150605:40"/>away, or prouide themſelues otherwiſe, ere they come to that age. Well then. Follow them where they goe, and where they ſettle, they muſt be ſome where. Still yee ſhall finde all one, and the ſame proportion whereſoeuer they become. But to leaue theſe, and come to thoſe, that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the latter halfe of thirty fiue, and vpward; there, the oddes is much greater; an hundred to one, <hi>Titleman</hi> ſaith a thouſand to one, that they neuer ſhall ſee Seauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye.</p>
               <p>Now what is become of all thoſe, that were once fiue and thirty with him? are they not all dead? but halfe a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, or not ſo many in a pariſh before they come to ſeauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or any thing neere it? yet thus it is in all places, and countries. There is a multitude of the younger ſort all of an age; but of olde folkes but a fewe, and almoſt none in compariſon. <hi>And</hi> therefore it is, I thinke that holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> ſaid, <hi>dies amorum noſtrorum ni ipſis, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 89.</note> The daies of our yeares (in themſelues) are threſcore and tenne; In them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they are ſo many: but in vs not ſo many, or in very fewe of vs. It is a time limited to vs, to which moſt fewe doe euer attaine. As if a man ſhould ſay, it is tenne mile to ſuch a towne to goe the next way ouer rocks, and places vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable; but the common way is twentie. In it ſelfe that is tenne, but to vs it is twenty. Euen ſo it is with mans age. There be that liue to thoſe great yeares, but ſo fewe, that a man needes not feare it, if he would not liue long; and it were folly to hope it, if long life be that he would haue. But my purpoſe is not to dwell vpon theſe points, which although they be true; yet I leaue them rather to your ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at more leiſure vpon theſe grounds I haue giuen you; then to ſeeme ouercurious in a matter ſo ſerious, as now I haue in hand.</p>
               <p>And yet I hope, this is not without fruite which I ſpeake of; For ſo much as euen in this the prouidence of God is ſeene ouer vs, and his tender loue to vs. His prouidence firſt, in foreſeeing our danger by liuing long. How many be there in the world, that wee haue knowne vertuous in their youth, and vitious in their age; in their child-hood tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150605:41"/>in their middle age of good example; in their elder yeares declining, and at laſt vnrecouerable. Which <hi>Dauid</hi> fearing in one place,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 70.</note> prayes to God, ſaying: O forſake me not Lord, when I come to bee olde. And of this wee haue diuers examples in Scriptures, <hi>Saul, Salomon, Ioas</hi> and others; who of Gods eſpeciall ſeruants, declined in the ende to bee Idolaters;
<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> or as ill. Gods loue alſo is heere to beſeene tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards his elect; for whoſe ſake as hee will ſhorten, and abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiate the whole world,
<note place="margin">Sap. 4 11.</note> and will haſten the end of it; ſo doth he in particular for many of his ſeruants, abridge much part of their time, that otherwiſe they might haue liued.</p>
               <p>And albeit that many liue longer for their amendment or increaſe of grace, which is alſo his goodneſſe, <hi>Patientiam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet nolensaliquos perire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.</note> ſaith S. <hi>Peter,</hi> he drawes out the time with many, that they may haue time to repent them: yet ſo it is, that God will haue vs ſee, and know, and take notice of it; what oddes there is againſt vs, that wee ſhall not liue long. Many ſignes in our body, that our time will be heere but ſhort. Many ſpectacles before our eyes, and warnings on euery ſide by others harmes, or vntimely deaths. New diſeaſes euery yeare, that will not let the bell ſtand; and ſometimes horrible plagues, and peſtilent agues, that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome touch olde folkes, but pull downe the luſtieſt. What ſhould I ſpeake of conſumptions, ſquinances, cough of the lungs; ptiſickes, dropſies, pleuriſies, collicke and ſtone, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargies, appoplexies, and ſometimes the ſweating ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that playes ſweepe-ſtake amongſt vs, when it comes, and theſe come commonly of miſdiet, or infection.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, the number is without number, that dye of age before they bee halfe olde: of age I ſay, becauſe it is olde age with ſome vnder forty, with ſome vnder thirty, with ſome vnder twenty, or vnder tenne, if God will haue them liue no longer; who hath appointed euery one their bounds, which they may not paſſe: <hi>Poſuiſti terminos, qui praeteriri non poterunt.</hi>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150605:41"/>reaſons alſo, beſides Gods ordinance, which are the ſeuerall indiſpoſitions of mens bodies, as wee learne by <hi>Aristotle, Galen,</hi> and <hi>Hipocrates;</hi> the pooreneſſe of moyſture radicall in infinite perſons, and the ouer abundance of it, in others, which naturall heate is not able to maſter. The faults alſo in our firſt conception, and generation (which no man knowes of but God) make an end of vs quickly, when yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger yeares promiſe longer life. To ſay nothing of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuolous</hi> influence of ſundry ſtarres the Lords of our natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or of them, that keepe no meane in their youth, and kill themſelues with miſrule. <hi>Plures occidit gula, quam gladius,</hi> ſaith one.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the manifold names our life is called by, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and fathers, doe ſhew the brittlneſſe and vncertainty of it; as when it is called a bubble, that is come, and gone in the twinkling of an eye.

Let life bee ſhort or long with vs, it is allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for our good, and the way to make vſe of it, is to thanke God, that it is no longer. If a man make reckoning of the beſt things heere, and would liue ſtill, to enioy them ſtill; let him know hee muſt forgoe them in the ende, hee knowes not how ſoone. His delights muſt goe one way, and hee another. Let him make much of life; for when life is gone, his ioy is gone. But if a man haue a true feeling, and knowledge of himſelfe, and of his life; and of the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it, how full of ſinne, and proneneſſe to ſinne, how full of inticements and euill <hi>prouocations,</hi> and dulneſſe to any goodneſſe; what ſtormes, and afflictions to beate vs from God; what danger in proſperity to neglect God; what multiplicity of buſineſſe to forget God, or to make vs loue him leſſe; hee will thinke it a bleſsing of God, not to liue long,

               <p>
                  <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelues, that had no light but naturall; yet ſaw they how good it was, to dye betimes. For when the good olde woman <hi>Argia</hi> was in haſte to goe to the ſacrifice as <hi>Tully</hi> telleth in his <hi>Tuſculan questions,</hi> and her Coach-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were out of the way; what did her two Sonnes <hi>Cleobis</hi> and <hi>Biton,</hi> but went in preſently to ſtrip and annoint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and drewe her thither in ſtead of horſes, in very good time. For which their act, ſhe beſought God to bleſſe them with the greateſt reward that could bee giuen to men. And ſo hee did. For the next morning, after ſhe had feaſted them ouer night, and ſent them well to bedde; ſhee found them both ſtone dead. <hi>Their</hi> guerdon of their <hi>Piety</hi> was ſhortneſſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150605:42"/>of life, as the greateſt good thing, that could betide them. And this no doubt doth many a good mother amongſt vs obtaine for her childe, when ſhee prayes for him, and thinks not that God will quit her ſo, though God doth know it to bee beſt ſo. Yea good king <hi>Dauid</hi> had not his prayers,
<note place="margin">2. Reg. 12.</note> when hee prayed ſo earneſtly for his childes life. God ſaw it beſt to take him away. And how much happier had it beene for <hi>Abſolon</hi> alſo, to haue dyed in his cradle, then liue to bee a Rebell. And to this purpoſe I haue heard a ſaying of <hi>Fredericke</hi> the third, that worthy Emperour, and it was much noted. That beeing asked once, what was the beſt thing God could beſtow on vs in the world, to be taken well out of the world ſaid hee: and yet hee taſted three and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares what it was to bee an Emperour, and to abound in peace, and in all good things.</p>
               <p>O what a benefite is this of God? What thankes doe we owe him for it? If a man haue a long way home in a hard winter time, and when hee comes to his Inne at night all moyled, and weather-beaten, (and muſt haue many ſuch dayes, before hee get home) ſhall finde himſelfe on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine in the middeſt of his owne yard; his wife and family with lights at the doore to entertaine him, a good fire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to warme him, and change to ſhift him, will hee not ſtand amazed, and fall on his knees with wonder, that his iourney prooues ſo ſhort? yet this can no man expect, nor can it be done without miracle. A Merchant likewiſe, that ſets out from the Indies with goods of great price: the iourney long and tedious, and no leſſe perilous. If he paſſe through ſafe, hee is made for euer; if hee miſcarrie, hee, and his are vndone; and euery day breeds new feares. Howbeit in putting in at ſome Cape three thouſand miles hence, if hee ſhould finde himſelfe at that inſtant iuſt before <hi>Calis</hi> or <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer;</hi> could any tongue expreſſe his ioy? Yet this muſt bee alſo by miracle. And theſe good happes bee neuer heard of, though in our caſe it bee ordinary, and daily done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miracle. So bountifull is Gods goodneſſe towards vs, that trafficke here for <hi>Heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our ſelues bee this Merchant, or Traueller, that would
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150605:43"/>ſo faine bee at home. Wee trade heere for good habits, and the grace of God, more worth a great deale, then golde of <hi>Ophir,</hi> or <hi>Heuilah.</hi> Our care is heere but for ſafe arriuall through a maine of miſeries, and contradictions in our way. It is common with God, to harbour vs at halfe way. The better halfe (as I ſaid) are not gone halfe way, but they are at their long home firſt: or if not, yet is it all one to a man, if hee bee of reſolution. Deſpare, and faint hee will not, but hold it out to the end. We may not ſticke in a ſlough ſtill, without ſtirring a foote, becauſe we haue a great way home. Wee may not caſt our goods ouer boord, becauſe we know not when wee ſhall make vſe of them. Wee ſhall ſerue God ſtill, feare him ſtill, loue him ſtill, and attend his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſtill, in little and great, in wealth and pouerty, in faire weather and in foule. Wee ſhall not value inward riches, at leſſe then outward; <hi>Heauen</hi> at leſſe then the world; nor take more care for clods, then for glory.</p>
               <p>If wee looke but for an Executor-ſhip, or to be ſome rich mans heire, wee are willing to obſerue him with all reſpect wee can; no duty, or ſeruice omitted if hee bee our better; no kinde of kindneſſe vnſhewne, if hee bee our equall; and this not for a moneth, or a yeare, but many yeares. And if it bee ſo, that wee thinke it long, yet waxe wee not weary ſtreight, or ceaſe to be reſpectfull, as long as wee haue hope. And if it were ſo, that a man ſhould be weary in ſuch a caſe, or ſhould neglect the inheritance that is ſo long in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and ſhould goe ioyne with an enemy, or looſe his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility for a horſe, or a hawke in hand; ſhould wee not holde him vnwiſe? Yet thus it is with moſt of vs in matters of <hi>Eternity. Heauen</hi> wee would haue, but wee will not tarry for it. Wee holde it tedious to bee ſo long <hi>Vertuous,</hi> and in the meane time, wee giue heede to our paſsions, and our humors beare all the ſway with vs. On the one ſide of vs loue of <hi>Carnality,</hi> loue of ſoft and ſweete, loue of money and momentaries; on the other ſide choller, pride, enuy, rancor, and reuenge, and what not beſides, that the Diuell will ſuggeſt. I ſpeake of many things, but one of theſe is enough to damne vs, and to turne Gods face from vs for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150605:43"/>euer; and all for lacke, of but a ſhort whiles perſeuerance. And this may ſuffice for the neereneſſe of <hi>reward.</hi> I prooued it before to be great, and nowe to bee neere, what can wee aske more.</p>

This is the laſt diſh we muſt feede on, ſerued into our table with a couer, that we may not ſee it, nor taſte it, vntill the couer of our fleſh be taken away. What it is, I cannot deſcribe to you, in other ſort then I haue done. Well I know, it is the ſame, that Angels feed on. The ſelfe ſame, that <hi>Cherubins and Seraphins</hi> delight in.

Whats a ſtones caſt of foule way, to a world of faire way? Is it to be ſtucke at. Whats a ſpoonefull of gaule, to a ſea of Roſe water? Is it to reckon of? For ſhame of our ſelues let vs thinke no time loſt, or long in Gods ſeruice. For if we doe, muſt we not looke to be puniſhed for it? and that by ſo much the more, by how much the more mercifull hee is vnto vs, in tempering as he doth our length of daies with ſo many delights, and pleaſing buſineſſe in the world; while either we recreate our ſelues moderately, ſleepe and reſt our ſelues temperately, conuerſe with others familiarly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirre our ſelues in our vocation commendably, ſee the fruits of our labour not without comfort.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150605:44"/>with all inticing fruits to fill our mouthes, and hands full all the yeere long, till new come in; and euery ſeaſon hath his lawfull pleaſures. Which if we abuſed hitherto, or haue ſpent our time vnprofitably, or haue liued badly; ſo mercifull is God, that he will not exact of vs, to beginne all our time anew, as tradſemen doe by their apprentiſes; but will take the reſt for good payment, that wee haue to liue, though it be but a yeare, ſo we pray hard, and will yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to amend. Haply hee will content himſelfe with two houres in a day, or with leſſe, ſo it be with feruour. And this is not the tenth part of our life, nor eight houres of the day, as king <hi>Alfred</hi> vſed, notwithſtanding his warres, and common-wealth affaires. <hi>What</hi> cauſe haue we now to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine?

Make haſt I beſeech you, for I haue ſhowne you the way. Let no impediment ſtoppe you, no time or temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on weary you in ſo important a buſineſſe. Waken your ſoules, that reaſon ſleepe not. Diet your bodies, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell not.
<note place="margin">Rom 1. Abac. 2.</note> I ſaid before, <hi>the iuſt man liues by faith.</hi> So doe you. Stirre vp your faith, that it lye not idle in you without fruit. Let vs liue by faith, as louers liue by loue. Their loue is life to their thoughts, and fire to their affections. They will doe nothing againſt lawes of loue; they ply her with all the ſeruice, and good offices they can; the ground of their hopes is but a word, or a good looke, or halfe a promiſe from her. Can we not doe thus to God? It is but changing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150605:45"/>and it is done. Keepe your loue ſtill, be enamored ſtill. That which was to a creature, Let now bee to the creator, &amp; then yee are right; hold your ſelues there, ſo it be to God. If nothing can pleaſe you but riches, and ſplendour, make vſe of your faith; and ye ſhall haue all contentment in him, that ye can deſire. If beauty delight you, reflect vpon your faith, and ye will neuer ſeeke other, then what yee finde in him. Your hope ſhall not be ſo weake, as louers hopes, vpon a word, or halfe promiſe. Euery leafe in the Bible is fraught with promiſes. She is your owne, what ſeeke you more, and if ye haue faith ſhe bringes all that is good with her. Doe as louers doe. Serue God and obſerue him, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ye haue in hand. Let your loue be t'one end of your thought. Marke what God loues in you, and doe it; note what he hates in you, &amp; auoide it. Let him be alwaies maſter of your heart, to gouerne it; miſtreſſe of your loue, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, a moſt bountifull rewarder, ye ſhall finde him, and a moſt beautifull miſtreſſe, yet none ſo meane in the world, but may haue her; none ſo great in the world, but may goe without her. How can a man be idle, and haue ſo ſweet a miſtreſſe to ſerue? night, and day, hee cannot ſinne, in thinking on her. But I leaue all to your good practiſe, ye haue heard (worthy friends) all that one body can ſay in ſo ſhort a time, in words ſo fewe and in a buſineſſe, ſo aboue all meaſure neceſſarie, and I may not ſpoyle with tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a matter ſo repleate with all pleaſantneſſe. Shall I aske you a queſtion, to make an end withall; yee ſhall not need anſwer me in words, but in thoughts. Is there any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuer in this place? Can any man perſwade himſelfe he ſhall liue long, or that <hi>heauen</hi> wil be had without much care? or that worldly cares do not hinder it, and hazzard it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly? Doe they thinke they haue no ſuch inheritance in <hi>heauen</hi> as I ſpeake off, <hi>Locum nominatum dabit eis pater meus,</hi> My father will giue them a place by name: or thinke they that the leaſt flower in <hi>heauen</hi> is not much more worth, then the faireſt bower on earth? that one glimps at Gods bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (if we might ſee it) would not dimme and damne the worldes greateſt happineſſe? that one peepe into <hi>heauen</hi> would not make our gold ſhew like leade, faire fields like a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150605:46"/>deſert, the bright ſunne like a ſparkle, beauty like the white skull of adead body? if any ſuch be heere asbeleeue nothing but what they ſee, delight in nothing, but what the baſeſt, dulleſt, and moſt vulgar delight in; I ſhall moſt humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate them for the paſsion of Chriſt, and for the true loue they owe themſelues, to informe themſelues better, by them that be better learned. Let them not be ſicke ſo dangerouſly and ſeeke after no remedy. But if it be ſo, as I haue no doubt but ye all beleeue mee, then tell me I pray; whether yee neede a ſpurre thither, that haue ſo faire a baite of it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yee neede a whippe, that haue ſo faire allurements to it; whether yee neede inuiting to your owne houſe, any bidding to your owne banquet, any inforcing to your owne poſſeſſion or proper inheritance: which if yee neede, I doe not maruell much in this great oppoſition of fleſh, and blood, which keepes you from ſeeing your inward marke; and which vntill yeeſee more perfectly, minde more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and aime at more feruently, as you doe at outward things; ſure, it is not with you, as it ſhould bee, and your preſent remedy is, to make a patterne of outward things, whereby to guide you to the inward. Who ſtumbles at money-bagge, and needes be bidden take it vp? who hath a a good legacy giuen him, and needes perſwading to goe fetch it? who is a hungred, and needes inforcing to fill his belly, hauing good meate before him. <hi>Sence</hi> furthers him in all this. And ſhall our faith be weaker then ſence, to further vs to the contrary? <hi>Sence</hi> telles vs money is better then Gods mercy; itching pleaſure better then <hi>Paradice;</hi> preſent momentaries better then future euerlaſtingneſſe. And ſhall our faith lye dead the whileſt. Take courage in God, and let not ſence ſo preuaile againſt it; Let not idleneſſe drowne it; paſsion ouerthrowe it; and filthy cuſtome cut the throate of it. Let faith rather goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and other things come after. When we follow one by night, our eye is neuer off him, for feare we miſſe our way; euen ſo let vs looke to our faith-ward alwayes, that our ſence ſeduce vs not in the darke of our vnderſtanding. If at any time ye be feaſting, or ſporting, turne your eye now
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150605:46"/>and then inward, and remember the grand-feaſt preparing for yee aboue. Are yee in ſorrow, or heauineſſe; ſtirre vp your faith a little, remember <hi>heauen,</hi> and ſorrow will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh like a bubble. Are ye at a royall maske, or other great entertainement? Thinke it all nothing to that is ready for yee in <hi>heauen,</hi> againſt ye come there. Haue ye loſt a friend or deare companion? Take the glaſſe of faith in your hand, and ye find an hundred for one more deare to you, then any can be vpon earth. Haue ye ſweetes at your noſe, or dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in your taſte? Dwell not on them too long, but reflect them higher. Are ye tempted with diſloyaltie, or other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience? Raiſe an <hi>heauenly</hi> thought, and it will vntempt you. Are yee in delight of harmony, the Waites perhaps at your windowe, to giue you the time of the day? Let this make worke for your faith, and quicken it, and make it eager after her <hi>heauenly</hi> harmony. Are ye melancholy at miſfortune, diſcontent with diſtreſſe, dazeled with gloomy weather, afflicted with reproach or obliquie? Repaire to your liuely faith; and it will baniſh all diſcomfort. Your field muſicke, and trumpets, that make you couch your lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and your horſes ſtampe vnder you, let theſe be your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larums againſt your triple enemie, that baricado the way betweene you and <hi>heauen.</hi> Let your inward trumpet ſound with your outward, to ſpend your ſpirits, and animate your ſoules, againſt any proffer to beate you from heauen. Doe ye know what <hi>heauen</hi> is? that noble <hi>heauen;</hi> that golden <hi>heauen;</hi> that glorious and delightfull <hi>heauen;</hi> that euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>heauen;</hi> where Angels becken you, and looke euery day for you, and will yee bee beaten from it? Doe yee know your right to it, the Ancientie of your title, and the price was giuen for it; and will yee bee beaten from it with any fire, or ſword, or haply with a lewd looke of an intemperate eye? Oh farre be theſe from your Chriſtian manhood; farre be it from your own ſelfe loue; far be it from your <hi>baptiſme,</hi> and grace of God in you. But mee thinkes I ſee <hi>heroicall</hi> ſignes in you: your faith leapes in your faces, your heart is in flames, and your ſpirit repleniſhed with reſolution, which giues great hope that the gates of hell will neuer preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150605:47"/>againſt you, nor ſtop you of your way, your way to heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I ſay, which I haue painted &amp; pointed you vnto. Haſte yee thither, and runne a pace, put wings to your willes, and out-ſtrippe all impediments: I conclude with Saint <hi>Paul. Sic currite vt comprehendatis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> So runne, as yee may catch. So run, as ye may obtaine what ye runne for. Let no man ſay he is fatte,

Not, that men cannot winne <hi>heauen</hi> that haue pleaſure; but they that ſeeke plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and poure themſelues out vpon it.

They are drowned in their owne deſires, and cannot breath for it. They are borne ſo downe with their burthen on their backs, that it is impoſsible to make way. The word is <hi>(ambulant)</hi> they doe but walke, not runne; and to runne thus, is not <hi>Sic currite.</hi> Runne yee the next way be ſure, and looſe no ground. Some againe there be, that runne with the Hare as they ſay, and holde with the hound. They flye vice, and yet
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150605:47"/>incline to vice, flye one temptation and entertaine another; flye the act, and delight in thought. Oh this is not <hi>Sic cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</hi> Long ſhall they ſo runne, and neuer catch. Wee are bidden ſo runne, as wee may obtaine. This word [runne] excludes all daliance, and delay. Wee muſt not ſtand at a ſtay, nor looke behind vs. This word <hi>[obtaine]</hi> includes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance, to holde it out to the ende. To runne therefore without wearineſſe, to goe forward ſtill without repentance; this is indeede <hi>Sic currite:</hi> this is to runne ſo as the Apoſtle will haue vs. The onely enemy to perſeuerance, is idle, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and vnſettled life. Make your ſelues buſineſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, that may bee good: and then let no alteration of time, or place hinder you; no hard fortune diſarme you; no fawning of any friends vnſtrengthen you. Let your word bee <hi>Semper idem.</hi> Hee that knowes yee now, and ſees you not againe of twenty yeares together; let him finde you the ſame, or better. Let all your neighbours report of your ſweetneſſe, all your acquaintance take example by you of much goodnes, and fetch fire at your <hi>feruour.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight noble audience, and fellowes at armes. I haue inuited you hither to day for your good company, which I can neuer be weary of: and partly alſo out of the aboundance of my heart, to impart vnto you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, that may ſtead you hereafter, whereſoeuer yee become. Yee haue beene pleaſed ere now, to heare your <hi>Generalls</hi> voyce halfe an hower together. And it hath beene I thinke for your good. My words concluded then with commanding, but now with intreating, and mutuall <hi>imbracing.</hi> Men of peace may bee to ſeeke in time of warres. So you, that come new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the warres, may bee to ſeeke of your carriage in time of peace. Yee were men of ſort, and noble, the moſt of yee, before yee came hither. And yee haue loſt no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by your comming, but ſhall returne into your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries (I doubt not) with much increaſe of honour. Honour in regard of your owne approoued valour. Honour in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the cauſe, and quarrell yee haue ſpent your time in, and much of your blood. For what more Honourable, then to fight againſt the great deuourer of <hi>Christianity,</hi> the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braider of <hi>Jſraell,</hi> and blaſphemer of the Sonne of God, <hi>Christ Ieſus?</hi> Yea, how much more honourable this, then to waſte our <hi>Jraſcible</hi> part vpon one another at home? Not onely to fight and kill, if we can; but when we haue done our worſt, to beare malice, and deadly feud ſtill, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150605:50"/>as long as we liue. A very bad vſe in our countrey. Euen family againſt family, and man againſt man, without all moderation. Thoſe whom God gaue his life for, we will take life from. Thoſe whom he ſuffered paine for, we would put to paine if we could, or to ſhame if we cannot. Thoſe who by generation, or regeneration, ſhould be our brothers, and all one with vs, all ſelected children of one God, and parteners of one bleſsing; we ſeeke to diſhonour by word, or deede, vpon euery light occaſion. We that ſhould beare one anothers burthen, and doe as we would be done to, we doe the contrary, heape coles one vpon another, deeme the worſt of euery bodie, as we liſt, neuer reflect vpon Gods Law, or mans Law, but how to wreake our anger, and make our humors therein both Iudge, and hangman.</p>
               <p>Thankes be to God, our hand hath not bin hitherto in our neighbours bloud. We haue ſpent our anger, and fury, where it can neuer bee ill, or better beſtowed, vpon the grand-enemies of God, our new <hi>Philiſtims.</hi> Whom to ſtrike is duty, to kill is Honour, and to bee killed of them a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. There to fight, wee are ſure is Gods battell; there to bee valiant, is true valour; there, feare wee no iniuſtice in the worſt wee can; nor neede to bee ouer ſcrupulous to thruſt our ſwordes in vp to the hilts. There to turne our backes is cowardize; there to bee afraide, is to bee white liuered; there, to ſhew pitty, were impiety; and they that ſhould bee fainting, or faulty therein, might be truely char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with diſhonour. The cauſe iuſt, and honorable; the quarrell Gods, not ours; commanded by lawfull authority, not by humane leuity. The honour ours, if wee winne; no diſhonour, if wee looſe, ſo we doe our indeauour.</p>
               <p>There bee men, too fewe for ought I ſee, to bee imployed in that honourable ſeruice. And yet wee fight, and wrangle, and kill vp one another at home, and robbe the Chriſtian common-weale of their intereſt in vs, without mercy, pitty, or true manhood indeede, as I ſhall prooue vnto you. If our idle ſpirits at home did but ſee, what we haue ſeene, the inundation of hell-hounds, that haue come downe vpon vs by hundreds of thouſands at once, their noiſe of armour,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150605:50"/>horſes, and howling; their pride, and fury againſt vs, the ayre filled with trumpet, fife, and drum, as if it were doomes day; our voyce crying out the whileſt to God, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to come helpe vs: men would not bee ſo idle and home-bredde, as they bee (for want of an enemy to poke and puſh at one another as they doe; but would couet to fight where men fight, and dye where men dye, and ſhall haue glory, and renowne for it.</p>
               <p>When yee come in your countrey againe, yee ſhall finde thoſe, euen ſuch as yee left behinde you, when you came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that neuer ſawe army in their life, and yet will giue lawes of chiualry; know not how to trayle a pyke like a ſouldier, and yet will braue a ſouldier to his face; were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer officers in the field, and yet if they haue beene at the Vniuerſity a while, and haue read a little of <hi>Liuie,</hi> or <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarks liues;</hi> and then come new to court, or Innes of court: they thinke themſelues ſtraight to bee <hi>Scipioes,</hi> or <hi>Hannibals,</hi> and fall to practiſing; and doe as they ſee others doe; learne to giue the lye brauely, or to vſe the fiſt, or poynard at the entring. It is the fault of youth, and of the times; and there bee too many of them at this day, but I hope there will bee fewer. Yeares, time, and better knowledge of themſelues, and of their owne woorth, will bring them more diſcretion. Meane time, I would there were not ſo many alſo of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficient, and of elder ſort, that thinke it valiant to bee ſtirred quickly, a word, and a blow with them, or ſpit in his face, and in the field next morning, to kill or to bee killed. And this not onely they doe, but thinke it lawfull to doe, and thinke it baſe, and cowardly not to doe.</p>
               <p>It is vndoubted, that Honour is a great ornament to him that hath it, and euery one ſeekes it in his degree, and ranke. And our countrey is as fruitfull of Honorable, and well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued perſons, as any nation in the world; and as quickly it is ſeene by them, as ſoone almoſt, as they haue caſt off their long coates. And as well furniſhed yee ſhall finde them with matter fitte to ſupport their honour, when they come to yeares; as either for manhood, valour, ſtrength, actiuity, or nobleneſſe of minde. All which as they bee vertues well
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150605:51"/>beſeeming gentlemen, and men may doe much to vphold them; ſo is it a moſt vnworthy thing, and worthieſt of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that they ſhould receiue blemiſh by any wrong.</p>
               <p>The moſt of you (as I ſaid before) are men of ſort, and as yee haue all deſerued well, and none of you the contrary: ſo is it neceſſary yee ſhould maintaine your Honour in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where yee come. But how? In Honorable ſort, without diſhonour to God, or diſgrace to your countrey, or Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne. And it will be expected in theſe corrupted, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuolous times; yea God will aske it at your hands, beeing men at armes, and neuer yet touched with the leaſt cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, no not when they haue beene fiue to one (I will not ſay ten to one) that yee ſhould ſhew good example to your countrey-men; and that your actions ſhould bee their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, your good experience their better learning, and your carriage their rule, that haue not ſuch cauſe to know what you know, or not ſo well as you, in regard of the long time, and place, yee haue ſerued in, where queſtions of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour haue daily riſen, and were ſeldome ſuffered by ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to come to blood, if they had authority to reſtraine them.</p>
               <p>The world is full of wrangles, and the good, and patient are abuſed, and abaſed euery where. <hi>Pride,</hi> and diſdaine haue filled all things with debate. One backbites, another is incenſed; one doth vnkindly, another taketh it ill; one meanes well, the other miſtaketh it; one giues a contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, another deales a blowe; and in all theſe is wiſedome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to carry an euen hand. And becauſe I would not wiſhe you to take ſo much wrong; nor yet to right your ſelues with any vnrighteouſneſſe: I thinke it good to let you knowe, and it is fit yee ſhould alwaies remember your duty to God, and the world, and to forget your ſelues as little as yee can, in hot bloud, or in colde. By hot blood I meane all ſuddaine things, before wee can well deliberate. By colde I meane, when the heate is gone, but deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge remaineth. To the firſt belongeth iangling, brawling, blowes, foule ſpeeches, and multiplying. To the ſecond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the dregges of the former, after they bee parted. The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150605:51"/>firſt hath commonly preſent execution while the fire is yet hotte. The ſecond hath time to pauſe; and if hee doe amiſſe, the fault is the greater. The firſt can neuer bee without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in the cauſe giuer, whether it come of heate, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, or ſcorne. For how can yee miſcall one, or giue approbious words without ſinne; neither is it without offence in the anſwerer, though not ſo great.</p>
               <p>He is more then a man, or leſſe then a man, that can put vp a contumelie on a ſudden.

                  <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe might ſeeme <hi>humanum pati,</hi> when he called him whited wall, that made him be ſmitten. What maruell then, if <hi>Achilles</hi> ſmote <hi>Thirſites</hi> for his foule mouth, though otherwiſe a man, that was not eaſily mooued. The beſt men will not ſoone giue cauſe. But <hi>vir iracundus prouocat rixas,</hi> A haſtle man,
<note place="margin">Prou. 15.</note> or a chollericke ſir will ſtill be quarrelling, and prouoking; euer vrging, euer miſconſtruing, neuer without a caprich, or two in ſtore. An other man as good as hee, will neuer doe it, but leaue it to ſcouldes in allies, and alehouſes. Hee will alwaies keepe himſelfe in compaſſe of manhood as neere as he can, and neuer debaſe himſelfe to ſuch vnworthy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>And there is a plaine precept for it, <hi>Nolite prouocare,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 6.</note> If I may not vrge my childe, or ſeruants to anger, how much leſſe my fellowe, or my better. The law giues fauour to man ſlaughter, if he be prouoked. But there is not a greater infamy to a noble perſon, then to prouoke or to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a quarreller. It is vnbecomming a woman, much more a man at armes. Quippes, girdes, flauntes, tauntes; farre be they from yee I beſeech you. They are but ſeedes of ſcoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the ſcumme of a womans witte; though ſome women delight in it, and thinke it worth printing euery word they ſpeake. Words breede quarrels, and of quarrelling comes blood-ſhedde. An old <hi>Coronell</hi> of ours reioyced on his death bedde; that hauing beene in many broyles in his life, and many times prouoked, he neuer gaue cauſe of quarrell by word or deed, and yet he would not turne his face from any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150605:52"/>man breathing.</p>
               <p>To detract, or reueale a mans ſecret, if it be not againſt the ſtate, or much hurtfull to his friend, is very vnworthy a gentleman, and breedeth much quarrell. A man of ſort would be loath to be thought a blabbe, or tell-tale. It begins with idleneſſe, and endes with damnation. <hi>Granado</hi> ſaith there be multitudes in hell for nothing elſe, but this. They ſay there would be no theeues, if there were no receiuers. And ſurely there would be no picke-thankes, or ſlanderers, if there were no hearers to delight in them.

               <p>To you my deere countrey men, and friendes (I muſt tell you) it is the principall ſcope of my ſpeech; that howſoeuer your ſudden occaſions of heate may carry you at any time ſomewhat further then vpon aduiſement you would, to breake the peace or bond of charity with any; and for which I can giue you no other rule, then the meaſure of Gods grace in you: yet vpon time of deliberation, and ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene; that is to ſay vpon cold blood, which was the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part I ſpake of, I doe wiſh much, and if I might I would command you, as we doe in the warres, that ye nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther challenge your oppoſite into the field vpon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; or if ye be challenged; that ye doe not accept it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing, both heinous in the ſight of God to doe, and no leſſe then <hi>hereſie</hi> to thinke yee may doe. This may bee newes to ſome of you. But not ſo newe, as true. Euill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions driue olde folkes to <hi>Schoole</hi> againe. And the eldeſt of you is not too olde to learne, if any of ye be poſſeſſed with that peſtiferous opinion. That it is heinous, and ſinnefull, it appeares by this, for that it is againſt the lawe of God, of nature, and nations. If againſt the lawe of God, then <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi> alſo to holde it lawfull. This is in ſhort, but I will make it more plaine to you, becauſe it is a thing, yee muſt informe your ſelues in, and it is groſſe to bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of.</p>
               <p>Single combate is honourable, if it bee in iuſt warre, or commanded by the <hi>Prince,</hi> or common-weale. As <hi>Dauid</hi> did againſt <hi>Golias,</hi> for auoiding of blood-ſhedde of many by the blood of one. Many in this kinde we finde in hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of one to one, or more to more, to weaken or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the contrary; and wee reade them willingly in our bookes. And God hath fauoured it ſo, that it hath ſaued the liues of many for the time. Wee haue alſo an ancient tryall for title of land, or appeales of felony by ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150605:53"/>where matters bee ſo obſcure, or otherwiſe carried, that common lawe or iuſtice can hardly decide them. And the forme is yet in vſe, but ſeldome ſuffered by Magiſtrates to take effect, as ſauouring more of heatheniſh times, when ſuch cuſtomes began, then of Chriſtian lenity, which thanks be to God hath almoſt worne it away. This kinde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate alſo is needfull ſometimes, and men be forced to it in defence of ones perſon, or purſe, or honor, to auoide a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinado, or ſuch like diſgrace. But this muſt be as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſay out of Saint <hi>Auguſtine, in delicto flagrante,</hi> vpon aſſault,
<note place="margin">Nauar.</note> or a waite; and <hi>cum moderamine in culpatae tutelae,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending onely their iuſt defence, and not otherwiſe. It muſt not be, if any meanes elſe be by flying backe, or ſtepping aſide ſayes the Lawe. But I holde it probable with others, that if one aſſault me, let him ſtand to his perill; he forces me to fight; I meete him not of purpoſe, nor vpon chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, which I may not doe, nor any authority vpon earth can giue leaue to doe, nor ſcarce conniue with, againſt the law of God, thou ſhalt not kill.</p>
               <p>The learned hold,
<note place="margin">Exod 20.</note> that by killing heere, is vnderſtood mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this difference is betweene <hi>killing,</hi> and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as betweene an act done of authority, and of our owne head. <hi>Killing</hi> is lawfull for Iuſtice, and for example. <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> alwaies vnlawfull, and damnable. And not onely the act of murther, but all that tends to the act is hatefull to God, and his Angels. Your <hi>challenging,</hi> or <hi>accepting,</hi> your proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding weapons, and preparing them, your going out of dooers, and entring the fielde; the drawing of your ſword, hitting, miſsing, wounding, maiming, killing or not killing; euery one of theſe is deteſtable, and abhominable; euery ſteppe you ſet forward in this buſineſſe, is a ſteppe to hell, and irreuocable woe. And that this is true which I ſay, or ſhall ſay, I could bring you excellent authorities out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine writers, that handle theſe matters in particular, and purpoſely; in their titles of <hi>Homicide, duellum,</hi> and tempting of God.</p>
               <p>But my purpoſe is not to reade you a lecture, or to make you any long diſcourſe with vouching, or proouing. And if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150605:53"/>yee thinke me wrong, or that I grate ouer hard vpon any mans diſtemper, aske any that haue learning, and cure of your ſoules, and they will tell you as much, and will ſhew it you out of their bookes, if yee will beleeue them. And yee ought to beleeue them in their owne art, as yee will be beleeued in yours. You know beſt, how to vſe your wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; they know beſt when yee may drawe it. And this was that Saint <hi>John Baptist</hi> taught ſouldiers, and gaue them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in, both for iuſtice, and charity, when they came vnto him, to know, what they ſhould doe. The Church liues now by the ſame breath it did then, and the ſpirit of the <hi>Precurſor</hi> periſhed not with his perſon. His doctrine, and directions doe ſtill remaine in the breaſt of our paſtours, with whom I haue conferred ere now, and haue read ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what my ſelfe; and what I finde by ſome ſtudie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, I willingly impart vnto you out of my loue. Euen that which hath coſt mee many howers, and daies, I lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, as court keepers doe, in an howers charge; both what yee muſt know in this buſineſſe, if ye be ignorant; and what ye muſt practiſe, and are bound to forbeare, when yee know it.</p>
               <p>The law of God is directly, you may not kill. And Chriſt addes a curſe to it, <hi>Qui gladium acceperit, gladio peribit,</hi> Hee that ſhall take the ſword in his hand, ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by the ſword. <hi>Virum ſanguinum, &amp; doloſum abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabitur dominus,</hi> God will deteſt him, and holde him abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
<note place="margin">Mat. 6. Pſal. 5.</note> that will ſteale the ſword out of the magiſtrates hand: for what is this <hi>virum ſanguinum, &amp; doloſum</hi> here, the man of blood, in guile; but hee that ſteales reuenge, and rights himſelfe ſo as publike iuſtice ſhall not know of it? Yee ſee what the Pſalme ſaith of him. God will holde him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable. And in another place if I bee not much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, wee are forbidden directly to doe it, with a grieuous curſe annexed thereunto by the Holy Ghoſt it ſelfe, the words bee theſe: <hi>Cum audace non eas in deſertum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 8.19.</note> Goe not out with an audacious body into the deſart, (ſaith hee) Goe not out alone as Duellers doe. For heere bee both parties touched very plainely as I take it. Firſt the cauſe giuer by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150605:54"/>this word audacious, or foolehardy; ſo called heere, <hi>Quia quaſi nihil eſt apud eum ſanguis,</hi> Becauſe bloodſhed (ſaith he) is as nothing to him. Likewiſe, the wronged by this word <hi>[non eas]</hi> Goe not thou, or bee thou not audacious as hee is. Goe not into the field with him. <q>
                     <hi>Vbi non eſt adiutorium elidet te,</hi> God will giue thee ouer for thy temerity, that hee ſhall kill thee, though thou bee a better man then he. Thou haſt withdrawne thy ſelfe from man, and God hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne himſelfe from thee. <hi>Non eſt adiutorium,</hi> How canſt thou ſpeede well, that haſt neither God, nor man on thy ſide?</q> Theſe Scriptures and many more, beeing ſo euident againſt it; I doubt not to adde, and inferre vpon it, that it is not onely ſinne to doe, but alſo hereſie to holde. What is <hi>hereſie,</hi> if this bee not <hi>hereſie?</hi> Wee neede not a councell to make it <hi>hereſie,</hi> when Scripture is contrary to it, as blacke is to white. It is <hi>hereſie</hi> to holde fornication lawfull, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lawfull, ſtealing lawfull, and ſo killing lawfull. And he that ſeeth not this to bee ſinne, his opinion herein may well be his puniſhment for his ſinne.</p>
               <p>Haply they will diſtinguiſh and thinke it <hi>hereſie</hi> with me for wilfull murther, but not for this. It is one thing to come behind a man,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and kill him cowardly, another thing to goe into the field with him vpon equall tearmes, with like wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, like health, and ſtrength, to trie their fortunes by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and this they will not be perſwaded to be <hi>hereſie</hi> in holding, or ſcarce ſinne in doing. <q>What ſhall a man dare me, and thou me to my face (ſay they) and bid me meete him if I dare; and ſhall I not dare to meete him without <hi>hereſie,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or ſin? <hi>grace</hi> they ſay helpeth nature, not diſtroyeth it, and the nature of man is <hi>gloriae appetens,</hi> deſirous of honor, and differs from a beaſt in nothing more, then in this. Take honor, and reputation from vs, and take away our life. They goe forward alſo, and tell of many worthy perſons, that haue loſt their liues thus for their honour; and it were impietie to Iudge them of <hi>hereſie,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or damnation, beeing otherwiſe known while they liued, to haue many good parts, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in them, which made them gratious in the world. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I hate my enimie ſay they, when I aske my due with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150605:54"/>my ſword; no more then plaintifes and defendants doe in their ſuites of law. They ſue for their goods, and wee for our honour.</q> And then they fall to reckoning;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> what good hath come of it ſometimes, when the impoſtume of their ſtomacks, and courages hath beene broken with ſome blowes, they haue beene greater friends after, then euer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies before. And this is commonly the effect of their Argument, the ſumme of all they can ſay. And it is no hard matter to anſwer.</p>
               <p>I will not ſpeake of the dead, they bee gone, and God forbid I ſhould iudge them.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Many braue men haue pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſhed that way. And what time they had for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or how farre their ignorance might excuſe them, I know not. Gods mercies doe ſo farre preuaile with his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; that wee muſt leaue it to him. I ſpeake of thoſe, and to thoſe, that be liuing.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Neither like I that friendſhip they ſpeake of, that comes of ſinne,
<note place="margin">Luk. 23.</note> like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> made friends by killing of Chriſt. Wee are forbidden expreſſely, not to kill at all. How can they thinke that they may kill, but it muſt bee <hi>hereſie?</hi> God ſaith they may not, they ſay they may. Their diſtinction betweene wilfull murther, and this, is ſomewhat, but not for this purpoſe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It ſhewes the one ſinne to bee more beaſtly, and cowardly then the other, not that the other is no ſinne; or not <hi>hereſie</hi> to hold ſo. They may prooue aſwell fornication to be lawfull, ſo they meane to marry after; lawfull to ſteale, ſo they meane to reſtore, when they are able; lawfull to ſweare idlely all the oathes of God, ſo they doe not forſweare; yet all this is ſinne to doe, and <hi>hereſie</hi> to holde; and ſuch diſtinctions will not ſaue it either from Gods law, or from mans. And for <hi>graces</hi> hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of nature; that is nothing to our matter.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>Grace</hi> helpes nature in good things, not in badde. And it is blaſphemy to vſe the word <hi>grace</hi> in that ſort, as to animate vs to ſinne, or to breaking of charity, or to get honour ſo diſhonourably.</p>
               <p>They ſay they hate not their enemy. I anſwer, they ſhall not bee iudged by their ſayings, but by their doings. If they doe the actes of hatred, their ſayings are but colours. Make the beſt of their caſe, that they goe not to fight, that they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150605:55"/>goe not to kill, but to defend if neede bee, and to ſhewe themſelues onely, that they dare meete their enemy in the field, and bee as good as their word. If he draw (ſay they) I will drawe. If not, I haue nothing to ſay to him. I will neuer aſſault him. But this is too <hi>mathematicall.</hi> How many bee there that goe ſo into the field? and yet moſt of vs know two noble young gentlemen now dead; my Lord of <hi>Digion,</hi> and Count <hi>La-vall.</hi> This latter had beene ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wilde, but much reclaimed of late. Theſe two had beene at high words, and compariſons, and <hi>Digion</hi> challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, and they mette next day accordingly with either of them a Page. <hi>La-vall</hi> threw off his cloake, and his rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er after it vndrawne; and tolde <hi>Digion</hi> hee would not fight. Why commeſt thou hither then ſaid hee? <q>becauſe I promiſed thee ſaid <hi>La-vall,</hi> and my word ſlipt from mee by chance. And yet I feare thee not (ſaid hee) but I will not diſpleaſe God, for a better man then thou. Thou haſt done mee wrong, and I haue done thee ſome; and ſo hee fell a dancing, with a turne and a halfe aboue the ground.</q> 
                  <hi>Digion</hi> was angry, and tolde him hee would diſgrace him, and make a boy of him, if hee would not fight. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall came towards him with a light thruſt. <hi>La-vall</hi> put it by with his dagger, and followed it quickly with a cloſe. <hi>Digions</hi> foote ſlipt, and fell, and <hi>La-vall</hi> vpon him, ſaying: <q>now I could ſend thee to the diuell: but thou ſhalt goe to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> firſt for abſolution, and ſo gaue him a kiſſe on his cheeke, and returned both friends, and did great ſeruice heere againſt the <hi>Turke</hi> after that;</q> where they loſt their liues with as much honour as might bee, as the world doth know. But how many be there, that goe ſo ſcrupulouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field as he did? And yet this going is ſinfull, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſeable, and by God forbidden, though yee make the beſt of it yee can.</p>
               <p>When God forbids murther, he forbids three things. The act, the intention, and all manner of concurring. The act is damnable, the intention of killing is damnable without act; and the leaſt concurring that is, comes little ſhort of it. And there be nine manners of concurring, as may appeare by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150605:55"/>an olde diſticke.
<q>
                     <l>Iuſſio, conſilium, conſenſus, palpo, recurſus,</l>
                     <l>Participans, mutus, non obſtans, non manifeſtans.</l>
                  </q> Here be nine words according to the ſeuerall waies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring either to murther, or any other notorious ſinne; as the learned doe define. And it is <hi>hereſie</hi> to defend the leaſt of them. Ye would thinke <hi>conſenſus,</hi> and <hi>palpo,</hi> were but ſmall matters; the one for conſenting that a couple ſhould fight, the other for animating, and incouraging them to fight, by praiſing it, and ſoothing them vp. Theſe be the leaſt, and yet very grieuous matters, and common-wealths, and lawes take hold of them in caſe of felony, or treaſon, and they are puniſhed little leſſe then principalls. Euen ſo in Gods court, the curious looking on, or negligence in parting, is inuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the ſame ſinne, and cenſure.
<note place="margin">1 Reg. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Heli</hi> was pittifully puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for wincking at his ſonnes abuſes, and not puniſhing them. <hi>Conſentientes, et agentes pari pena plectentur,</hi> ſaies the lawe. And <hi>Saulus erat conſentiens neci eius. Saul</hi> was as deepe in the murther of Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> for ſtanding by, and keeping their cloathes, as others that ſtoned him.
<note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> This is the lawe of conſenters, this the lawe for counſellours, and abetters; this for flatterers, and incouragers, how much more then for acters, and deede-doers.</p>
               <p>More then this I haue knowne, where the partie could neuer be prooued to know or conſent to murther, and yet hath iuſtly ſuffered for it. As it happened lately in <hi>Tholoſa,</hi> where a great iuſtice was done vpon <hi>Madamoiſella violenta,</hi> a yong woman of good breeding, beautie, and comelineſſe, if ſhee had bin honeſt. But ſhee was kept by two, a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and an <hi>Auguſtine</hi> fryer. Who to colour their lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, put a husband to her. This husband deceiued their expectation, and ſent her into the countrey twenty mile off, that he might haue her alone to himſelfe. But this coſt him his life. For he was murthered on an euening in the backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the towne as he was croſsing the fieldes. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers, and one or two more were executed for it, and the poore woman for company, that knewe nothing, as I ſaid.

They ſearch one another to the skinne, that there bee no let of ſpeeding; runne at tilt one at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be ſure to ſpeede; two courſes make an end of one, or both. And if one of them chance to be ſcrupulous, how long will it laſt, if a wound begin to ſmart once, or the blood to couer their eies? how can theſe eſcape the vengeance of God, that goe to kill, or bee killed, and glory in it, when they haue done. He ſhall be prayſed of men for it; ſhall be called ſtout, a man of his hands, a braue man; and why? he hath killed two or three.

Bee there any heretikes in the world, if theſe be not heretikes?

Let not the new neſſe of it, (if it be new) diminiſh the credite of it in your greene conceits. The lawe of God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150605:56"/>I am ſure is not new, how new ſoeuer in our practiſe. What ſhould I ſay more to Chriſtians?</p>
               <p>Yet ſomewhat I ſhould alſo ſay of the lawe of nature, or nations, which was long before this. The law of nature was <hi>quicunque effuderit ſanguinem humanum,
<note place="margin">Gen. 9.6.</note> fundetur ſanguis illius,</hi> His blood ſhall be ſpilt, that ſpills the blood of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is the booke of Geneſis. And if a man will haue a reaſon of it, a reaſon is there giuen. <hi>Ad imaginem quippe Dei factus eſt homo,</hi> He that kills a man, kills the image of God; Why ſhould I ſpite him, or malice him? Hee is my owne Image, though neuer ſo hatefull in my eie; why ſhould I ſtrike him, except God bid ſtrike, or the common weale? But note I beſeech you the puniſhment annexed to it. Blood will haue blood. <hi>Fundetur ſanguis illius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ibid. 18.</note> It ſhall coſt him his life. And the Hebrew hath <hi>per hominem.</hi> As he killed a man, ſo a man ſhall kill him againe. That is to ſay the magiſtrate, or executioner, by <hi>lex talionis.</hi> And this hath beene the practiſe of all nations. No hiding would ſerue their turne, but they were mette withall at one time, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as heathens themſelues haue noted, and haue admired Gods prouidence in it. And if ſome haue eſcaped, yet this breakes no rule, but among <hi>Epicures;</hi> who attribute all to fortune, while God (they thinke) is a ſleepe, or neuer mindes vs.</p>
               <p>Againſt whom I remember a graue ſaying of <hi>Iſocrates</hi> in his Oration <hi>de pace;</hi> wiſhing them if they be wiſe, not to hope of impunitie, becauſe ſome are not puniſhed. <q>For if there be ſome that eſcape (ſaith he) yet the moſt doe not. And therefore it were wiſedome to prouide for that, which is moſt common, and likely. And it is moſt fond (ſaith he) when God is knowne to loue Iuſtice, to thinke that hee cares not for the iuſt; or that the wronged ſhall haue worſe fortune then the wronger.</q> Thus he. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is an olde tradition of the Iewes, that <hi>Caine</hi> himſelfe, before euer there were Magiſtrates, could not eſcape this heauie iudgement, to be killed by man, although he had a marke ſet on him, that none ſhould kill him. But ſuch was Gods iudgement, as he could not auoide it. Blinde <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi>

               <p>But to returne to our matter; and to leaue the Scriptures, and Church lawes; becauſe they be not altogether our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, and the word, and the ſword ſeeme contraries, and they that be ill diſpoſed haue no skill of it:

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150605:58"/>died. The other of France began his raigne with blood; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing way to a combate between <hi>Jarnac</hi> and <hi>Chaſtenroy,</hi> vpon no great matter, but to grace his triumph with: where <hi>Jarnac</hi> though newly recouered of an ague, defeated the other at length, &amp; killed him in the place. Neither of the kings much fortunate by it. The one was kild by <hi>Mongomery</hi> in like tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph at tilting after a ſhort reigne: the other held not his crowne ſo void of feare, and iealouſie, as other kings after him. And yet I maruell much more at other Princes of our time, who in their triumphs and iouiall feaſts, allow of thoſe dangerous and damnable ſports of <hi>Jogo de toro,</hi> and <hi>Jogo de Canna,</hi> which commonly coſt killing, &amp; cannot be auoided. It is too like that <hi>Romane</hi> cuſtome of fencers, &amp; ſwordplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, &amp; thoſe that knew not God.
<note place="margin">Lib. 28.</note> Who ſet their liues &amp; blood to ſale as <hi>Liuie</hi> ſaith, for paſtime to their Lords, or in honor of ſome feaſt, or generals fortune; where they ſpared not at ſharpe, to kill one another, if they could.

               </p>
               <p>Yet nothing more frequent in hiſtories then ſingle fight, as that of <hi>Patroclus</hi> and <hi>Hector, Hector</hi> &amp; <hi>Achilles, Xanthus</hi> and <hi>Melanthus</hi> for the kingdome of <hi>Athens, Codoman</hi> and another for the kingdome of <hi>Armenia,</hi> the three curiates and <hi>Horaces</hi> in <hi>Rome, Tullius</hi> &amp; <hi>Metius,

But all theſe were <hi>iure belli</hi> (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) from contrary enemies. And of all the combates that <hi>Marcus Seruilius</hi> fought for life, &amp; death, which were three and twenty, and he conquerour in all;
<note place="margin">Plut. in Emilius.</note> I reade not of any to be with his compatriot, but all with publique enemies in lawfull warres. And that was neuer vpon their owne heads neither, but with conſent of <hi>Generals,</hi> as we reade in <hi>Liuie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 7.</note> Yea though a man be challenged by name from the other ſide, as <hi>Titus Manlius</hi> was, and where it ſeemed reprochfull to haue refuſed it, yet it coſt him his life the accepting of it. I will tell you the hiſtory.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:150605:59"/>
               <p> The lawe of armes is, that none ſhould fight in the wars out of their rancke, but by direction of the commanders. <hi>Manlius</hi> the father was generall againſt the Latines at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua. The ſonne had charge of a troupe of horſemen, and was ſent to diſcouer the coaſtes of the enemy. Where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming within an arrow ſhot of the corps de-guard, which <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius Metius</hi> a valiant knight had leading of, they fell to ſome big, and daring words, &amp; the Latin challenged the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to breake a ſtaffe with him. Young <hi>Manlius</hi> his blood was vp at this, and thinking it a ſhame to him to refuſe him, hee aduanced himſelfe to the buſines; they ranne their horſes in full careere one againſt the other with ſpeare in reſt. <hi>Manlius</hi> with launce aloft glided ouer, and raſed the enemies head-peece. <hi>Metius</hi> gaue the other a light thruſt vpon his horſe necke with point of ſpeare. Then turning their horſes about, <hi>Manlius</hi> came firſt vpon him with a ſecond charge, and ſo redoubled the puſh, that hee pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the others horſe between the eares, which put him to ſuch paine, that he neuer left rearing, and capring with his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feete, and flinging downe his head till hee caſt his rider. Who as hee bare his ſpeare and ſhield, to raiſe himſelfe from ſo grieuous a fall, <hi>Manlius</hi> ranne him in at the throat and ſo through the ribbes ſtucke him faſte to the ground, killed him, ſpoiled him, carried the ſpoile away to his owne troupe, and had ſentence of death on him preſently for it, from his owne father, in liew of reward. The iudgement I grant was ſeuere. And the execution proſecuted with much compaſsion, and teares. Yet none could ſay but it was iuſt, and the puniſhment anſwerable to his fault. And of great example it was, to reduce broken diſcipline to the ancient rule, as it would among vs now, if gentle meanes would not ſerue. Some difference indeede there is in our caſes. Theirs was in time of warres, where challenges are lawfull. Ours in time of peace, where is no challenge lawfull. Yet in this they agree. There, they might not doe it without leaue of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; heere much leſſe; yet if they haue leaue, I thinke it be leſſe ſinnefull.</p>
               <p>And ſurely if we enter but into the cauſes of priuate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150605:59"/>which are commonly two; there is neither of both that will make the act iuſtifiable. The one is reuenge, the other is reputation. And firſt for reuenge; which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon alſo to beaſts and ſauages, and is more in ſauages then in men; and therefore men muſt not doe as they doe; ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge be, they care not how it be. Men I ſay muſt looke higher then ſo, and then they ſhall finde this cauſe to be no cauſe, vnleſſe they will ſtand in defiance with all <hi>ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,</hi> and God himſelfe, who tells vs plainely to the contrary, <hi>Mihi vindictam</hi> ſaith he, <hi>et ego retribuam.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom 12.</note> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues reuenge to himſelfe, and to princes vnder him. And who is he, dares ſay againe, <hi>Non tibi domine, ſed mihi,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge is mine, and none of thine, I will right my ſelfe. And in another place it is ſaide, <hi>Ne dixiris,
<note place="margin">Prou. 20.21 Aug. in Steph.</note> vlciſcar de inimicis meis,</hi> Doe not ſo much as ſay I will bee reuenged of mine enemies. And therefore, if we may not ſay it, much leſſe may we doe it. Reade all the ciuill lawes that euer were, and ſee whether the ſword were put into the parties owne hand. It is tolerated in Italy as I ſaid before, as the ſtewes be, to auoide further miſchiefe, and no otherwiſe. As God did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the Iewes, that were a nation of all others moſt reuengefull; he gaue ſome way to their ſtiffeneſſe, that <hi>the next of kinne to the party ſlaine,
<note place="margin">Num. 35.19</note> might kill the killer when hee could.</hi> But this was aboliſhed by the comming of Chriſt. Neither was it permitted him to kill, vntill the people had giuen ſentence; as it appeares by the text.
<note place="margin">Verſ. 24. Verſ. 27.</note> Yea ſo farre was the lawe from allowing otherwiſe this priuate reuenge; and ſo heauily taxed it all manner of manſlaughter; that if it were but chance medly, or in defence of ones ſelfe, a man was not freed from the rigour of it, if he were found out of ſanctuary. To ſay nothing now, what vicinity reuenge hath with tyranny, and cruelty; which thoſe are noted to haue moſt, that are moſt cowardly, as the moſt noble and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned king of England hath written of late moſt ſignificantly for ſo few lines, where occaſion was giuen his maieſty,
<note place="margin">Vpon the Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. pag. 80.</note> to touch thereat; and thereunto I referre you.</p>
               <p>And as touching reputation, which was the other cauſe of combate, and is proper onely to man, and which hee
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150605:60"/>thinkes is greatly hurt, if he be wronged and challenge not, or if he bee challenged and anſwere not, in both which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if he be not anſwerable: hee ſhall be deemed a coward. I little weigh what they ſay, that are carried away with a vice <hi>regnant,</hi> Corrupt iudgements are no iudges of honour. <hi>Holofernes</hi> his followers thought it a ſhame to let a faire wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man paſſe them vntoucht.
<note place="margin">Iudith.</note> The vertuous thought not ſo. Yea: that alone is honour, which the worthieſt thinke to be honour, as I ſhall ſhew anon. For this preſent I ſay no more but this. He that hath reuenge in his power, hath alſo iudgement of honour; let the vulgar ſay what they liſt.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 71.</note> We pray for kings and magiſtrates thus. <hi>Deus iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umregida, et iustitiam tuam filio regis,</hi> For the king, that he may haue iudgement in choice of magiſtrates; for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, that he may haue will to doe vs right. <hi>Da iuſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am tuam filio regis.</hi> Who is the kings ſonne but the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, begotten of his greatneſſe, and reſembling him in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer? We pray for him, yet we fly him when we haue done, and will be magiſtrates our ſelues. What, muſt we trouble Lawyers or Lords (ſay they) for euery blowe or word of diſgrace? it ſhall neuer be ſaid of me. This is it ſhall right me ſaith he, and clappes his hand on his hilt.</p>
               <p>But what reaſon haue they to ſay it? if the matter bee great, the magiſtrate is ordained for it, to heare and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. If it be ſmall, why aduenture they their life for it, or ſeeke another mans? They ſcorne to doe as babes doe, to cry and complaine; yet will be worſe then babes, to wrong themſelues more then they be wronged. For if himſelfe be killed, what extreame iniuſtice hath he done himſelfe for a trifle. If he kill, he muſt hide his head for it, his friend may not receiue him til he be acquitted of it ſomeway. The great neſſe of his penaltie ſhewes the greatneſſe of his crime. And we ſee not whom we hurt, till we need him whom we hurt, which is our Soueraign. We wrong ſoueraignty to right our ſelues, and yet we ſeeke <hi>Soueraigntie,</hi> to reſtore vs againe.</p>
               <p>I prooued before, that it was not onely a ſinne to doe, but an hereſie to iuſtifie. Euen ſo in this caſe betweene our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne</hi> and vs, it is not onely againſt nature to doe theſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150605:60"/>things, but alſo againſt loyaltie, to thinke wee may doe it. I ſaid it was <hi>hereſie</hi> in reſpect of <hi>religion.</hi> Now I ſay, it is hurt to maieſty in point of ſubiection. As king <hi>Alexander</hi> might ſeeme to take it, who was no meane <hi>Justizer</hi> in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall affaires. For comming iuſt to a fray betweene two of his fauourites that were ready to bee reuenged one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſwordes drawne: hee was in great anger, and tolde them they ſhould both dye for it, or hee that gaue the cauſe, if they did it againe. And this not for killing, or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of blood, but onely for the diſloyaltie, and contempt of maieſty, in the very attempt. And yet yee muſt vnderſtand mee right. I doe not ſay it is treaſon. For it is not to the perſon of the Prince, or eſtate. They intend nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Maieſty, yet would mince his authority. They loue the ſtate, but they would pull from prerogatiue. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe them to bee their Iudges, but not in all things; no, not in the greateſt, that belongs to their charge. What greater thing in the world then life, and honour? There be diuers markes of <hi>Soueraignty,</hi> which none can haue but <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignes.</hi> And it is a great contempt in the Subiect to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe them. As power of peace and warre, power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king lawes and abrogating lawes, power to make money and alter money, power to make noble and vnnoble, and ſuch like. But the greateſt of all, is power of life, and death ouer the ſubiect. Yet this the ſubiect will aſſume to himſelfe in part, and quarter prerogatiue with his Soueraigne.</p>
               <p>And is it maruell then if <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of France haue made it treaſon by parliament,
<note place="margin">Edict. 160.</note> and haue ſtopt his eares to all offenders in this nature? Or can wee finde fault with the lawes in England, that a Duellor killing, is equally pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a theefe ſtealing? A theefe commonly hath not friends to ſpeake for him.
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.</note> But S. <hi>Peter</hi> puts them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Nemo vestrum patiatur vt homicida, aut fur.</hi> A theefe ſteales for neede, the other killes for honour. If a man bee poore, yet hee muſt not ſteale; if a man bee diſgraced, yet hee muſt not kill. If either of both tranſgreſſe, the lawe makes no difference betweene them. Their paine is alike, therefore their fault alike.</p>

                  </q> No difference in puniſhment, therefore no difference in crime. No friend in parliament, hath mooued for altering the Law, either for one, or other, though the one bee the caſe of many a good gentleman. Whereupon as to this point, wee may boldely affirme, that your Duell, as it is vſed, and is equally puniſhed with greateſt faultes, ſo is it in his owne nature an euill thing, and tending to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt euill. It is offenſiue to God, iniurious to Soueraignty, diſgracefull to the common-weale, and that which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth further to be prooued, to themſelues that bee the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers moſt of all diſhonourable.</p>
               <p>It is no ſmall charge, I lay vpon Duellors; and it may be I bring a challenge vpon mine owne head for calling it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonourable. Yet ſince I haue partly prooued it by the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the puniſhment (vnleſſe it bee ſo that they holde themſelues <hi>Martyrs</hi>) I hope they will pardon mee, if I prooue it further. For I haue not ſo many heades, as I would aduenture in making this good. Diuines do prooue it ſinfull, and I muſt prooue it diſhonourable. And this I ſuppoſe were eaſily prooued, if our greateſt ſouldiers, that haue beene, had written of this matter, that wee might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their authorities. But it ſhall not neede. Their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe is a better teſtimony then any bookes. And yet wee may gather out of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> who was himſelfe a noble ſouldier and <hi>Historiographer;</hi> what hee thought of this buſineſſe, when hee calleth priuate reuenge a vice. For, giuing a reaſon, why we are more reuengefull for a wrong, then thankefull for a benefit; he ſaith it is, becauſe reuenge is a vice, and <hi>vitium in queſtu eſt</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>gratia oneri,</hi> Vice makes ſhew of gaine, though a man haue but his will of one; where thanks is a burthen, becauſe a man is bound to it.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:150605:61"/>
               <p> And ſo <hi>Polibius</hi> another ſouldier, and an honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, companion with <hi>Scipio,</hi> in his ſecond booke is ſo farre from our mindes in this; that hee calles it <hi>nefas interficere ciuem,</hi> A horrible thing to kil our countreyman any way. He commendeth ſingle combate with a publike enemy, in his ſixt booke, and extols the <hi>Romanes</hi> for vndertaking ſuch challenges, but not <hi>inter ciues.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paul. Diac. lib. 14.</note> Yea the practiſe of <hi>Aetius</hi> was quite contrary to ours; who although hee were the greateſt <hi>ſouldier</hi> in the weſt, and a terrour vnto <hi>Attila</hi> whom hee draue out of <hi>Jtaly</hi> with loſſe of all his men: yet he fled his priuate enemy, and emulator at home, and thought it either iniuſt, or diſhonourable; or both, to fight in that ſort. And what doe wee reade of <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> a great leader amongſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> when hee was bitterly prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by <hi>Minutius,</hi> and (as his friends thought) very intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably; his anſwer was as I haue reade, <q>that hee thought them more cowards that were mooued with floutes,
<note place="margin">Naucl.</note> and taunts, then they that flye their enemy.</q> Loe heere what our grand Maſter ſaith, that wee ought not to bee mooued, and much leſſe reuenge our ſelues with word or blowe. Which when ſuch an one as hee hath ſaide, beeing no light headed man, but deepe of iudgement, wee muſt thinke his authority to be a reaſon ſufficient.</p>
               <p>But the onely man of <hi>Mars</hi> that hath giuen his opinion freely though ſomewhat ſparingly in this buſineſſe; is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry late writer, but one who for wit and education could ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well iudge of honour. And yet he ſpares not to ſet downe for perpetuall memorie; <q>that no man in honour ought ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a priuate challenge, beeing a thing ſo oppoſite as it is, to Gods law, and mans. The law of man (ſaith hee) hath appointed the Hangman to ſecond the conquerour; and the law of God hath appointed the diuell to ſecond the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered ſo dying in malice. Whereupon hee concludes it to bee both fooliſh, and baſe, to accept of ſuch challenge as is ſo baſely accompanied.</q> All which hee hath reaſons for, if a man will reade him. And it is not without cauſe that hee calles it baſe, and Ruffin-like, ſince the nature of cowardize will approoue the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:150605:62"/>
               <p> For what is cowardize, but an acte againſt reaſon; done for feare, in matter of courage. As to runne away at ſight of drawne ſwordes, whereof hee had no reaſon, but his wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh feare. Firſt wee haue prooued already ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate to bee an act againſt reaſon; and I will prooue it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine thus. It is an act againſt the ende of euery common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, which is peace; and therefore vnreaſonable. It is an acte concurring with the inclination of beaſts, if they could ſpeake, and therefore vnreaſonable. Wee ſee two dogges when they bee parted, they runne out of company to fight alone. And <hi>Pliny</hi> writes of a Lyoneſſe that roamed vp and downe the deſart to encounter the Beare, that killed her whelpes. But yee will ſay, I may forbid you as well to eate and drinke, and defend your ſelues, becauſe it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of beaſts. Not ſo, yee muſt make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene actes that bee naturall which muſt bee, and no law is againſt; and actes of paſsion, which reaſon is alwaies againſt, vnleſſe it bee in beaſtes that haue no reaſon. And therefore I prooue it thirdly to bee an act of paſsion, <hi>ergo</hi> vnreaſonable. That fighting and reuenging be actes of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſtomacke, is prooued firſt <hi>a contrarijs.</hi> For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrary actes of patience, and forbearance, are actes of reaſon, as I will ſhewe anon by examples of the worthieſt; <hi>ergo, reuenge</hi> muſt needes bee an act of paſsion. I prooue it againe thus. Paſsion commands reuenge; delights in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, is eaſed with reuenge, as the olde <hi>Satyre</hi> ſaith.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150605:62"/>it now to be an act of feare alſo, which was the other part of my definition. And which although it ſeeme hard to prooue, becauſe there is no ſigne of feare that appeareth, yet if we finde any feare at all, it will ſuffice.</p>
               <p>There is a feare, which is of death or maime. But this they haue not, no more then vnreaſonable creatures haue, when they aſſault one another. There is alſo an other feare which is a feare of ſhame, and diſgrace with the vulgar; and that is a baſe feare, but yet they haue it. They feare not what the beſt thinke, but onely what the vulgar, and moſt thinke. And were it not for this feare, haply they would not fight.

                  </q> They feare more euery idle breath of a mans mouth, then loſſe of their life.

Others <hi>ignobile vulgus,</hi> the baſe conceited vulgar, and <hi>inſipiens vulgus,</hi> the doating vulgar, that iudge not rightly of honour, or any thing?</p>
               <p>The laſt part of my definition was [in matter of courage] And matter of courage is, where a man may, and is bound in honour, to vſe courage. If I ſee my friend aſſaulted; here is matter of courage to defend him. If my maſter, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant be in danger, and I runne away, here is want of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. If I ſee a gentlewoman abuſed, or diſgraced in the ſtreete, and I can right her with my ſword, the defence is honourable; and a thouſand things beſides, wherein to bee fearefull, or ſhrinke away, is want of manhood, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and the party to be charged in point of honour. But to ſay that that is honour or cowardize which the vulgar only thinke ſo, that, is (as our author ſaith) both fooliſh and baſe. And the king of France and Princes of the blood call it brutiſh madnes; &amp; haue adiudged it no true honor. For who made the vulgar iudges of honour,
<note place="margin">Edict. of 1609.</note> that gentlemen ſhould ſtand ſo in feare of their cenſures. Indeede if they were brought vp as gentlemen be, or gentlemen brought vp as they ſhould be; their iudgement and opinion might iuſtly be feared; and ſtoute men would not dare to doe as they doe, for feare of true ſhame. But the ground of honour is horribly miſtaken by vs, which is not altogether in bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or hardineſſe, but as it is imployed in vertue, and true proweſſe.</p>
               <p>Who is there in the world, can tell vs what is honour, if he know not what is vertue? Is it honourable to haue ones will in euery thing? Honorable to be on fire quickely, or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150605:63"/>giue a ſcoffe readily, and to thruſt into euery fray? theſe be gracefull things with a great many. But let no man tell me of honour in action, if it bee not for ſome vertue, that makes the motion. I holde <hi>Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Theſeus</hi> honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſtrength of body, and durable nature, beſtowed where it ſhould be. I holde thoſe ſouldiers honourable in times paſt, that wonne the crownes.

All bee honourable that doe honorable things; diſcouer treaſons, ſaue blood from ſpilling, houſes, and townes from burning with daunger to themſelues. Honorable <hi>Scipio, Hanniball, Pompey, Caeſar, Alexander;</hi> Honourable all men at armes, Graue <hi>Senators,</hi> and counſellors moſt honorable of all, next vnto Princes, that rule the world in their chaire, and giue to all men their due. And theſe may be called heroicall honours. But the bounds of honour goe further then this. There is honour due to all kinde of Excellency. And in the meaner ſort it is called praiſe. Each profesſion hath honour, or praiſe with it, euen to the meaneſt that is. And as euery one excels in the ſame facultie, ſo are they more noble, or more praiſe worthy then other.</p>
               <p>Now, which of all theſe doe our Duellors excell in, when they make challenge or anſwer? which of theſe vertues doe they ſhew in it? what innocent defend they by it? what good to the common? what duty to God, or man hath drawne them to it? Ye ſay honour is a vertue, and that yee fight for your honour. A faire Lady is precious, and yee fight for her loue. A ſatisfied minde is a good thing, and ye fight for obtaining it. And if you get any of theſe thus, yee ſay it is honourably gotten. Pardon me I beſeech you, It is not honourably gotten. It may bee ſtoutly and hardily gotten, but not honourably. Ye abaſe honour, when ye apply
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150605:64"/>it thus. Friendſhippe is not friendſhippe, if it be to a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. Duty to ones father is no duty, if it be to ouerthrowe a city, or common-weale withall. We may ſay, there is met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and courage in a villanousaction, and matter of honour in a rebell diſhonourably beſtowed, as it was in <hi>Clodius,</hi> and <hi>Catelyn.</hi> Will ye wound your ſelfe to ſhew a paſsion of loue? or ſtrike him that is next you to ſatisfie your minde? be theſe good meanes to get honour? and if it were good that we deſired, were it honourably gotten, to get it ſo gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily <hi>per fas et nefas?</hi> Say your meaning be good, yet the meanes muſt be lawfull, elſe the act is diſhonourable. And that this meanes is vnlawfull, I haue prooued already both by Gods lawe and mans law, and the light of nature. Chooſe which ye will ſtand to, it goes againſt you. Wine is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, &amp; profitable out of a cup, but good for nothing if you powre it on the ground. So courage is indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to good and euill; but neuer honorable with diſhonorable circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Thinke not ſo baſely of your courage, as to ſpend it ſo vainely. Thinke not ſo meanely of your manhood, as to trifle it away in boe-peepe, and leaſt be-ſeene. Either ye be bad Oratours, that defend ſuch doings no better, or elſe your cauſe bad, that hath no other ground for it but vulgar errour; nor other authority for it, but a tumultuous ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſcite (as it were) without a <hi>Senate.</hi> The breeding of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen is ſuch (as I ſaid) or ought to be ſuch, as they ſhould neuer doe amiſſe for want of knowledge. Howbeit becauſe they be ignorant in theſe matters, and do not as they ſhould doe, but meaſure honour by hardineſſe onely, and thinke they haue found their helmet, when they finde but the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſeeke no further: hence it is that the common ſort doe ill alſo, when they (they ſee) doe ill, that haue better breeding, and giue no better example.</p>
               <p>But I may not ſtand too long with ye vpon a point, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the bounds of a charge, eſpecially when other things are to be ſpoken of, that are very conſiderable about this this ſubiect. For beſides the iniuſtice, and diſhonour of it, which by your good fauours, and patience I haue prooued, and will appeare more plainely heereafter,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150605:64"/>wee will ſee next, what manner of tryall it is; to the end, that if it neither bee iuſt in it ſelfe, nor the tryall reaſonable; wee may wholly exclude it from the ſocietie of men. The tryall many times is ſuch as a man would laugh at, if it were not ſo common, and many times vnhappy withall. Men be neuer ſouldiers vntill they fall out: and then euery country man is a caualeer. Young lawyers, and ſchollers bee ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; the ſeruing-man, tradeſman, and artificer is turned ſouldier on a ſuddaine. They will bee honourable in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, if they come to ſee faſhions, and vpon their honours they will ſtand. The queſtion betweene them is for honour, or honeſty; who belyed other, who wronged other, and was the honeſter man. And they muſt try it by that, which they haue no skill in for the moſt part. They flye to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans trade, and runne away from their owne. No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tryall will ſerue but at ſharpe. That which is peculiar to men at armes for God, and their countrey; they practiſe forſooth of their owne heades, and fall to thraſhing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, chance it as it liſt. I hard a merry ſtory once, but it was true; and a good iudgement vpon the caſe, by a knot of good fellowes, ſuch as ſetued the turne.</p>
               <p>Beeing once at ſupper in my brothers houſe the Duke; newes was brought vs, of a fray newly paſſed betweene two of the meaner ſort. The one I knew, his name was Pot, a bigge fatte fellow. The other was an Ale-man, of ſtature ſmall, but nimble, and deſperate. Theſe two fell out in a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, and appointed meeting next morning at foure a clocke, in a cloſe at the townes ende. The Ale-man had pawned his dagger, and was driuen to goe out with his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle rapier, that ſtucke at his beds head, and came to the place appointed firſt. Anon after hee ſpied his fellow afarre off come tumbling ouer a mudde wall, with a tree on his necke to his thinking; but when hee came neere, hee ſaw it was a long raile, ſharpened on the one ſide. But beſides this, hee had two weapons more vnder his girdle. A long reaching rod, and a whip made of a bedſtaffe. What (ſaies the Ale-man) doeſt thou think me an oxe, or a dog, or a bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching boy, that thou commeſt in this ſort? and thou (ſaies
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150605:65"/>Pot) doeſt thou thinke mee a peece of beefe, that thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt with a butchers pricke in thy hand? I will lay you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non (ſyrra) ouer yonder blocke, and you ſhall feele mee as long as theſe laſte, and ſo lettes driue at him with his raile. Backe goes the Ale-man, till hee could goe no further; and then thought beſt to drawe his enemy into the middeſt of the field againe, and to runne round about him. Pot fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hee would runne him in behinde, was driuen to turne round with him, till hee was almoſt turne-ſicke, and craued parley. But the Ale-man would none of that; but ſpying his aduantage to come within him, Pot ſtrucke at him with a mighty blow, and brake his rapier all to peeces, and ſtucke his raile faſt in the ground. And while he was ſtruggling to get it out; the Ale-man ſteppes to him quickly, and twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches his whip from him, and laide at his legges withall. The other leaues his raile, and drawes out his rodde, laſhes him on the face, and almoſt cut off his noſe. The Ale-man fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his buttons couered with blood, takes the butte end of the whip, and the other the great end of the rodde, and here began a new battell; vntill Pot reaching at him to catch holde of him, the Ale-man by chance, hit him right vnder the eare, and laid him aſleepe, and fledde. Next day in the afternoone, it was both their happes to meete at a blinde ale-houſe in an alley, and a new brabble towards, if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there had not ſtickled betweene them. They fell to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripping of olde matters, and much adoe there was about wronging, and diſhonouring. Till ſome of the ſtanders by tolde them: <q>yee were both fooles (maſters) to deale with weapons yee had no skill in. And if wee had beene of your councell (ſaid they) yee ſhould haue both of yee met faſting in a morning, with a dozen of pots a peece, well filled, and haue tryed it out who ſhould ſtand longeſt.</q> And with this, they called for halfe a dozen freſh cannes, put both their honours in a pot, and made an ende of the quarrell.

If any ſort may doe it; the kings men may, and ſquires for the body, <hi>Pentioners, guard,</hi> and other neere his perſon; who ought to bee men of likely valour, or truſt, and to feare no man: and yet wee haue prooued, that they may not doe it, when the precept is generall that none may doe it. And Princes take it not well, when perſons ſo neere them be ſo highly carried away, as to tranſgreſſe ſo groſſely. Princes themſelues are ſacred, and hate blood, if it bee not to ſaue blood, hate effuſion, if it bee not to ſpare effuſion. And if they were Gods, to know mens thoughts; a bloody minde ſhould neuer approach our Sanctuary of peace, to ſtayne his houſe, and bring a curſe vpon it, where a bleſsing is due.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if any elſe bee, that may breake the peace, a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier may, and men of honour, whoſe ſpeciall profeſsion is to handle armes, and to ſtead their countrey that way as occaſion ſerues. And yet there is no warrant for them to doe it. And wee reade how <hi>Titus Quintius Criſpinus</hi> a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> would not doe it of his owne head, though neuer ſo much prouoked, and challenged moſt reprochfully by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> from the contrary army, where it ſeemed moſt diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to refuſe it. And although hee vndertooke him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ranne him into the ſhoulder aboue his ſhield at the firſt career, and vnhorſt him, and made him runne away and leaue horſe, and ſhield behind him: yet this was vpon ſuite firſt, and with leaue of his Generall. Which hauing, he could not refuſe combate without cowardize; but not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150605:66"/>hauing, to refuſe was honourable. And I tell it you for this. That if <hi>Criſpinus</hi> could put vp ſo many reproches as <hi>Liuie</hi> ſets downe for order,
<note place="margin">Lib. 25.</note> and duties ſake in the warres; is it not much more to bee done in peace? if hee regarded not his priuate honour for the publike in warres; ſhall wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne a ciuill warre (for ſo is your <hi>Duell</hi>) and preferre our priuate before the publike in peace? if hee for thoſe due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, would breake no peace in warres, ſhall wee bee ſo rude and vnreſpectiue towards the publike, as to breake peace in peace? Is not the like obligation of ſubiects to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours in peace, as it is in warres, or not rather ſo much greater as they haue leſſe excuſe for it, and more blame if it bee broken?</p>
               <p>But to forbeare you a little, and to yeeld a little to ill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and bad applyed courage; becauſe yee ſhall not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge mee, I will challenge you firſt. Let any man affoord mee a ſound reaſon, why ſingle combate ſhould bee a true tryall of honour, or honeſty; as to ſay which of them was in the wrong, and which in the right; or which more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, or valiant then other; for that is all the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them; not who hath more courage, but who hath more honour; not who more deſperate, but who more wronged. That is it, they goe into the field for, to make their ſayings good vpon each others body. Will conqueſt fall out alwaies with him that hath right? Doe the valian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alwaies goe away with the victory? If this were ſo, it were ſo newhat. But when it is not ſo, they that thinke ſo, tempt God, and ſinne in preſumption; which I ſhall prooue vnto you thus.</p>
               <p>As all our actions while wee liue are humane; ſo our try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls vpon difference muſt bee <hi>humano more.</hi> Wee muſt not looke to heare God ſpeake, but by deputies and magiſtrates; we ought not expect miracles, nor bee our owne Iudge. Elſe why doe wee not fight for our lands and goods, as the law of Lombards was with ſhort ſtaffe and target. Why fight wee not with our treſpaſſour, but goe to lawe with him? Before there were Tribunals, I maruell not much. But ſince there were lawes, and law-makers, and ciuill, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150605:66"/>orderly gouernment; our learned hold it <hi>piaculum,</hi> a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tempting of God, to waiue publique iuſtice, and to be our owne tryers. If one call mee villaine, theefe, traytour, baſtard, or periured; hee ſhall pay deere for it in body, or purſe. If hee ſlaunder mee otherwiſe of ſinne, or crime; I haue remedy in court Chriſtian. Wee ſhall not neede appeale to fire, water, or ſword, as they did in olde time, when other iuſtice could not bee had. So <hi>Tutia</hi> fetched wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a ſieue from <hi>Tyberis.</hi> And ſome haue floated aboue water, tyed hand, and foote. The Empreſſe to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, walked fifteene paces on hotte iron, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue done before her. And ſuch an other like tryall there was litle more then a dozen yeares agone. in the Eaſt-Indies, in the kingdome of <hi>Malabar.</hi> Which becauſe it is rare, and may be ſuiting to my argument anon; let it not bee troubleſome to ye that I ſet it downe, as I finde it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Jacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Alexis. hiſt.</note> and <hi>Achar</hi> his wife a faire conditioned cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the towne of <hi>Mangata</hi> after ſome children had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them fell at a little variance vpon ſuſpition he had, that ſhe was not altogether chaſt. And this the good woman tooke ſo exceeding ill, meaſuring the depth of the wrong, by the height of her innocency; that ſhe demaunded iuſtice of the heathen king, and would be tryed by fire. Forty daies ſhe tooke to prepare her ſelfe with prayer, and deuotion. When the day of tryall was come, ſhe alſo came. Thither came the king, and all his nobility, beſides a number of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Moores, Iewes, and Chriſtians not a fewe. Before whom a harth of fire beeing made in the front of the Church; ſhe puts her ſelfe vpon her knees before the king, and lifting vp her eies to heauen, Lord Ieſus Chriſt (ſaide ſhe) our true God, that madeſt both heauen and earth; thou knoweſt the truth of my innocency. Make knowne I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee to all this people heere, that Chriſtian wiues if they follow thy commandements, commit no adulteries, nor falſifie their faithes, which they haue giuen their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. Shew to all theſe, that wee be not diſhoneſt with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or thinke of any thing more, then to accompliſh thy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150605:67"/>lawe, and to liue chaſtly with our husbands, in hope to haue children, and to increaſe thy faithfull. I adore thee my onely true God, and I keepe thy commandements. Then turning her eies to the king; Sir ſaid ſhee, you that be our king; we are bound by the lawe of Chriſt, to render you obeiſance. And here I ſweare before you, and before all theſe, by the lawe of Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, whom I worſhippe; that I haue not onely not committed adultery, nor wronged my husband; but alſo haue not any thing thought againſt coniugall <hi>chastity</hi> which I owe him. And with this, ſhe put forth her hands to one that laide greene leaues on them as their faſhion is, and another tooke a red hotte Iron barre, and laide it on the thinne leaues, which ſhe held faſt, vntill it was turned blacke; and then they tooke it from her. The king, and as many as would, drewe neere, to view her hands, which they found vntoucht, and likewiſe the leaues vnſcorcht. And the woman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, ſhe neuer felt any heate at all, ſuch as was likely to hurt.</p>
               <p>This ye may thinke, made a great aſtoniſhment amongſt infidels, and ioy to Chriſtians, when it pleaſed God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with it as he did. Euen ſo againe for tryall by ſword. Wee haue one notable inſtance amongſt others in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time;
<note place="margin">Naucl.</note> who tooke to wife a faire young Lady, the king of Englands daughter. She was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of incontinency by a ſeruant neere the Emperour, a man of monſtrous bigneſſe and Giantly ſtature, <hi>As the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man writer ſaith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Naucl.</note> And there was no man durſt vndertake the vertuous Ladies part, ſo much as to ſpeake on her behalfe; vntill in the end, ſhe challenged the Giant to fight with a boy of hers, which ſhee carried out of <hi>England</hi> with her. The time, and place was appointed. The onely comfort the Giant had in his wounded conſcience, was the weakeneſſe of his enemy. His victory as hee thought was aſſured. But he was deceiued. God was greater then hee. For the boy aduentured ſo boldly, and with ſuch a ſpirit towards him, not afraide of his bigge lookes, and ſcornes, and heauie blowes, (which would beare downe an oxe) that after a few
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150605:67"/>boutes, he thruſt him into the thigh, and wounded him ſo ſore, that he could ſtand no longer. The <hi>Emperour</hi> at this was much confounded; and would haue had her againe. But he had more to doe for her ſecond good will, then euer hee had for her firſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like reſerued tryals, wee heare, and reade of in caſe of extraordinary neede, and Gods particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. Which euery one may not preſume vpon as I ſaide. And to expect it of God, is to tempt God; and ſo is holden by the ſeruants of God, that are of learning and experience; as by the ſtory I told you of the Indian woman, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. For although ſhe eſcaped the fire marueilouſly; yet whether it was for her ſake, or for conuerſion of heathens vpon that occaſion, God onely knoweth. And the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoppe of Goa a very learned man, beeing then in the ſame towne by chance, about his viſitation, would not onely not giue countenance to ſuch a tryall with his owne preſence at it, but rather miſliked her that ſhee would take no other ſatisfaction when it was offered her; yea alſo when ſhe came to him afterwards, hee tolde her plainely in the hearing of many; <q>that it was not for her merit that God wrought this wonder; for we be all wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſinnefull creatures ſaid hee, as long as we liue in this mortality.</q> But it was for poore infidels, and heathens ſake, that knew not the good of Chriſtian marriage, nor how pleaſing it is to God to holde onely to one (which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grieuous to them) both in deede, and thought. By which words ye may ſee how little he accounted of this tryal; as of a tryall; although he gaue ſome way to it, becauſe he would not abreuiate the hand of God amongſt thoſe blind infidels in an act, which otherwiſe he might thinke to be meere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and tempting of God.</p>
               <p>And this tempting of God is a greater ſinne then we are aware of, and is ſo called,
<note place="margin">Guicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardin. Comines.</note> becauſe we tempt him thereby to doe a miracle or extraordinary fauour vpon vs. As a <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobin Fryar</hi> did a little before our age. Who ſtanding in contention with a certaine <hi>Franciſcan in Flarence,</hi> challenged him to walke with him through a great fire prepared of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150605:68"/>purpoſe in the market place, with the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in his hand. And this is called <hi>tentatio expreſſa,</hi> a groſſe tempting. And the Magiſtrates puniſhed him for ſuch attempting. There is an other tempting alſo which is called <hi>Tacita;</hi> when a man intends not actually to tempt God, yet what he doth, he hath no reaſon for, but tempting of God, and meere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. As one that is deadly ſicke, and will take nothing, aske him why? God will helpe ſaith he, when he ſees good. A man may ſay to him againe, doe you looke for a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle? and in this they offend God preſumptuouſly in time of the plague; that goe ſo boldly to viſit the ſicke, as if it were but an ague, and this for no other cauſe, but to viſit, or to ſhew their boldneſſe, and to boaſt of it afterwards that this they haue done, and how little they feare death; or how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they bee for God, more then others are. If they will needes tempt God, let them doe it where they hurt none but themſelues; and they are ill aduiſed that animate them therein, without all manner of neede. A Biſhop likewiſe, or other eminent perſons offend heerein, that are notably ſlaundered, and will not ſtirre in it, but leaue it to God, hauing good iuſtice, and meanes for it.</p>
               <p>The like of all lazie-bodies, that will take no paines for their liuing, ſaying God will prouide for them. Doe not all theſe tempt God? and ſay with him in the Goſpell, Lord,
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> Lord; but will doe nothing for themſelues? And this <hi>Tacit</hi> or ſilent tempting comming alwaies of ſloth, or pride, prouokes God much; beeing oftentimes ioyned with repining, and banding at authority, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> anſwered them againe, <hi>Quid iurgamini in me,
<note place="margin">Exod. 17.</note> et tentatis dominum?</hi> Why doe ye wrangle with mee, and tempt your Lord God? So <hi>Iudith</hi> to the prieſtes in <hi>Bethulia,
<note place="margin">Cap. 8.</note> Qui eſtis vos, qui tentatis domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num?</hi> Who are you that tempt God, when ſhee ſawe them limite God to their lawes, and ſubiect him to their falſe feares, as <hi>Duellors</hi> doe? By which ye may ſee, it is no newe ſinne I ſpeake of. And wicked <hi>Achaz</hi> was ſo well inſtructed, as hee acknowledged it a ſinne, when
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150605:68"/>God bad him aske a miracle, and hee ſhould haue it. But pretending holineſſe, hee ſaid no, I will not aske.
<note place="margin">Eſay 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Non petam</hi> ſaid he; <hi>non tentabo dominum,</hi> I will not ſinne in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thee; beeing holden euen then, a grieuous ſinne, and we cannot plead ignorance of it now.</p>
               <p>But to come neerer our purpoſe; our <hi>Duellors</hi> ſinne this way in the groſſer manner. And I appeale to their owne conſcience, whether I ſay not true. <hi>Briefely</hi> thus. They ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome regard the oddes, or inequality that is between them, no more then <hi>Dauid</hi> did againſt <hi>Golias,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Porus,</hi> who was two cubites higher then hee: and yet the leſſer ouercame the greater, when it was an hundred to one againſt him in ordinary reaſon. <hi>Dauids</hi> victory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, is attributed to Gods reuealed aſsiſtance, which gaue him boldneſſe in his buſineſſe. But <hi>Alexanders</hi> onely to his fortune, as I ſhall ſhew you anon. They care not (I ſay) for oddes in their perſon, oddes in skill, oddes of experience. His enemy haply hath beene in many frayes; or may be as ſtrong as <hi>Pompeys</hi> man was, who mette with his challenger in the field without weapon, and brought him away into the campe with a finger: yet all is one to him. What ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues this, but, (I will not ſay) a miracle, yet an admirable conqueſt? They preſume of ſetting fortune heere againſt nature, chance againſt reaſon. I aske whether this bee not true? It may bee, ſome are more wary or fearefull. But moſt commonly it is true. I aske them ſecondly what makes them ſo preſume? They cannot ſay their skill, if the other haue more, not their ſtrength if the other be ſtronger, not their courage when the other may haue as much. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay their right, for that is the queſtion; neither can they ſay their fence for their body, for they goe not out like men, many of them; but more like ſauages without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Their onely fight at this day is with ſingle ſhort ſword. The knowledge whereof if it bee right, hath aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of any other. For hee hath a whole body to hurt, and but halfe a body to defend. But beeing ſo, that few haue true skill of it, it is both dangerous and ſpeeding, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tolerable in a kingdome. I feare mee, they will come
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150605:69"/>ſhortly to the caſe of bodkins, or the Dutchmans ſtabbe or cut, with either of them a whitle, all vnbraced, and vntruſt, as if they went to a bacſide rather, then to a tryall of life, and death. How farre is this from the ancient doctrine of manners, or manhood, now corrupted wholly, by the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart humours of a number of deſperates; who if it were a faſhion to ride out in the raine, and leaue their cloakes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them, no doubt they would follow it.</p>
               <p>Yee thought much euen now, that I called it diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to challenge, or anſwer. But as they vſe it now; I may ſweare it is diſhonourable. For it is deſperate, therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonourable. What more deſperate then to bee careleſſe of ones life, when it is ſought; or to hazzard it for want of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. They caſt vs their gauntlet when they challenge, and leaue it behinde them when they come to fight. Yee may learne of <hi>Thucidides</hi> (who was himſelfe a ſouldier alſo) that the right ſide of a man is to vſe his weapon with,
<note place="margin">Lib. 5.</note> the left to defend with. Ours goe to it like halfe men. The great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> hauing taken diſtaſt againſt many of his <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Potentates,</hi> ſent them a challenge thus: <hi>That hee would defend himſelfe againſt them all;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudith. 1.</note> ſhewing by this, that the chiefe part of a ſouldier is defence. Ours challenge alſo, but he that brings his mothers ſpindle with him, brings as much defence as they. Ye haue beene in fencing ſchooles, And the firſt thing yee learne is your wards and locks. Ours bring nothing to ward withall. If yee haue beene ſchollers, what learne yee there, but to defend, more then oppoſe? Hee is the beſt ſcholler, that defends his concluſions beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that come.</p>
               <p>Take away defence therefore, and take away manhood. A man may refuſe you with honour, if yee barre defence. For the fight is not like a man, but like a beaſt without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And yet verily it is a wonder, to heare our <hi>Duelliſts</hi> talke among themſelues. <q>By God hee killed him brauely ſay they; I ſay ruffinly, without defence. Hee killed him manfully, I ſay caſually without defence.</q> Hee killed him valiantly, I ſay fearefully without defence. All night-feares would haunt my ſoule, if I ſhould kill a man ſo. For though
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150605:69"/>I had my ſelfe no more defence then hee; yet my ſin would bee the greater, the more way I gaue chance, to tyrannize without defence. Duell is ſinfull euery way, but without defence, it is a ſinne againſt nature. So farre is it from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, one naked man to conquer another, without defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archidamus</hi> the Lacedemonian Duke gaue his men this rule; that when they went to fight,
<note place="margin">Thucid. lib. 2.</note> they ſhould prepare themſelues as if they feared, and fight as men that dared, and how is this preparing, but by defence?
<note place="margin">Iliad. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Homer</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends a ſword-man, by his defence, not by his offence, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne loricati Achiui,</hi> his bright armour, brigantine, or coate of plate. Hee commends a fighting man thus, <hi>Galea galeae, cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peus clipeo,</hi> Helmet to helmet, or buckler to buckler, not poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard to poynard, or waſtcoate to waſtcoate, as our carpet knights doe. The old Greekes gaue them puniſhment that went into the field, not without ſword or launce, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out buckler or ſhield.
<note place="margin">Dioniſ. Hali. lib. 4.</note> The <hi>Romanes</hi> likewiſe appointed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one after their quality, what to haue for their defence, howſoeuer their weapons were. The beſt and ableſt had their ſiluer buckler, and head-peece of ſteele, their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat alſo, and ſteele bootes. The ſecond had the ſame, all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the curat; and inſtead of a buckler, they had a ſhield. The third had like the ſecond, but no bootes. The fourth or meaneſt that bare armes had their target, and might not goe out without it. They made reckoning of a mans life, and that a man was but a man; his skin is not of a Lyon, or of dagger proofe. And ſo ſhould euery man thinke of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And if hee bee a gentleman, his ſcutchion of armes that makes ſhew of a ſhield, doth put him in minde how to goe into the field; or at leaſtwiſe not like ſlingers, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that come behinde the campe, and can reach to no higher fence, then their fortunes. If our loſſe bee no more then of a dogge out of the way, wee may fight like dogges. But men, I would haue to fight like men, and they are bound by nature to it, as ſure as they can for the part defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, howſoeuer they bee for the offenſiue, as it is in the warres; and why not? Now what is it then, that makes them ſo bolde, and yet ſo naked? Surely it muſt needes be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150605:70"/>this, that they preſume to haue God on their ſide, if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing; and ſo (to my former ſaying) they tempt God. Or if it bee as they ſay, their fortune they ſtand vpon, they tempt their Lady fortune, which is very deceitful. And they doe not as we do in the warres. We will not hazzard our ſelues vpon a notable diſaduantage; and it is no diſhonour to refuſe battell in that caſe, vnleſſe wee cannot mend our ſelues, and bee driuen to it perforce.</p>
               <p>Now laſtly; ſuppoſing equality, and that there is no oddes betweene them; but that the one is as ſtrong, valiant and able as the other; although the iniuſtice of the tryall ſeeme better cloaked, yet it is tempting of God notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. For they cannot deny the ſword to be one of the three trials extraordinary. They may not vſe triall by fire, nor by water, therefore not by ſword without tempting of God. For though a man expect not a wonder in conquering his enemy, as by fire, and water hee doth; yet tempteth hee God in one of theſe two waies. One is in preſuming of Gods fauour in a wrong if he haue wronged his enemy. The other is in ſeeking Gods fauour inordinately, though hee haue right on his ſide. Hee will challenge God forſooth to right him with an extraordinary tryall, which I prooued the ſword to bee, and ſpoiles his cauſe by it. For ſo it may bee ſaid of him.</p>

               <p>As if a man ſhould giue me a Iuell, and I go picke his locke, or his pocket for it. Would this bee well taken? Haue I not loſt a friend by it? This kind of preſumption is towards God as vngodly, as the other to man moſt vnmannerly. And I ſhall wiſh you to take heed, and enquire of it further; for it will ſtand yee much vpon.</p>
               <p>And yet to giue you this alſo, and to free you from an audacious preſumption; which I can by no meanes doe: yet I may not allowe this tryall to be a tryall indifferent, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:150605:70"/>reaſonable, but falſe, vncertaine, and deceiuable, as I prooue to ye thus. There is no man can make a tryall certen, whoſe iſſue is chance. But the iſſue of combate is chance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tryall vnreaſonable. That the iſſue is chance, it appeares by the many caſualties that combate is ſubiect vnto, if his foote ſlippe, or ſword breake, the ſunne, wind, or duſt, in his eies, or if his breath faile him, hee is gone. Neither is a man alwaies in beſt practiſe for his defence. <hi>King Porus</hi> looked aſide a little, hearing his men in tumult behinde him, and <hi>Alexander</hi> tooke aduantage of it, and ouerthrew him.

               <p>The inſufficiency of this tryall is alſo ſeen, by the little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme is made of it by the whole body of iuſtice. King, Councell, Iudges, Magiſtrates, and all the graue heads that are in the world. All that ye haue yee holde by their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and iudgements, the cloake on your backe, and your ſword in your hand. Yet they holde ſuch conqueſts of yours as nothing. They will not condemne the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the worſer man, or commend the conquerour for the better man, or that he who hath the day, hath alwayes right on his ſide, as commonly he hath in iuſt warres, and ſo is noted by <hi>Pomponius Laetus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendio. lib. 28. Liuie. 7.</note> But in ſingle fight it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten contrary. As we may ſee in <hi>Corbis,</hi> and <hi>Oswaes</hi> caſe, two principall men of Spaine while <hi>Scipio</hi> lay there; who would haue <hi>vmpered</hi> the matter betweene them for the principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Ibes. But they were both reſolued; no tryall but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, either take all, or looſe all. The apparant right was in <hi>Oswa</hi> who ſtood vpon his ſpirit, and flouriſhing youth. The other was both older, and ſtronger, and ſtood vpon his <hi>skill.</hi> Much preparation was on both ſides, and great concurſe of people, and friendes. But the ſtronger obtained the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the younger paide deere for his leuity. Like caſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:150605:71"/>wee finde in king <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixts time of England, how <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cartur</hi> was trayterouſly appeached for a traytour by his own ſeruant, and in combate was ſlaine by him in Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fielde, the ſeruant carrying away the victory, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the honeſty, as it was deemed and pittied by all that knew him. And it was not long, that the ſeruant could eſcape the iudgement of God for it, being hanged ſoone after for another fault.</p>
               <p>Neither will ſuch conqueſts be ſo much as an euidence in any court of audience. As for example, one cals me theefe, or baſeborne. I challenge him the fielde, and am ouercome, and he goes away with my ſword. After this, I bring my action of ſlaunder. Hee pleades conqueſt by battell, and ſhewes my ſword for a teſtimony, with other witneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. Yet all is nothing. I ſhall haue dammages againſt him notwithſtanding. But I leaue theſe matters vnto yee, to bee better conſidered of; as alſo the humours of men, from whence this vnciuill buſineſſe proceedes. Greene heads commonly without ripeneſſe, courage without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, good mettall ill applyed, good ſignes till impolyed; and to put all in a word, the greateſt aduenture that is, for ſo ſmall a prize; as appeares by the fruites of it, which are two.</p>
               <p>Firſt a cruell repentance, if euer wee come to repent vs, but eſpecially if death followed. Wee muſt remember one day, or at ſometime or other, when wee ſet alone, and thinke of things paſt, that hee was our brother, whom we maliced, or ſupplanted ſo. Hee was partaker of one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome with vs; Like fleſh, one countrey, the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage with vs. Perhappes hee was our friend and louer in his heart, howſoeuer he might be ledde by humane errour, and peraduenture our kinſe-man, or allie for any thing we know, or care for in our paſsion. If euer we come to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber our ſelues, we ſhall rue it moſt pittifully, and with the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of extreameſt compaſsion. Alaſſe for pitty, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take warning one by another; yea that euer we ſhould weare a ſword, and vſe it no better. How many bee there that periſh thus of cold iron in this iron age? how wanton
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150605:71"/>be they with their weapons, after they get a little fence, and are not at quiet, till they haue ſheathed it in their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers boſome, or lye breathleſſe, and ſpeechleſſe vnder the ſurgeons hands? They paſſe a tryall indeede; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Truely, in my opinion of the greateſt miſery, and moſt comfortleſſe deſolation that may bee. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictus perijt, luget victor,</hi> As the olde Oracle went, neither of them honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by it, both of them miſerable, and who can tell which more? Whether he that is by this time God knowes where, or he that ſuruiues; and though he bee in his right minde, yet cannot make amends, or bemoane it ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>The ſecond fruite if we may call it ſo, is an abhominable blindneſſe of heart, which they bee growne vnto. Let vs ſpeake but of one or two of their lawes, that they liue by, and dye by. Our young <hi>Solons,</hi> and <hi>Lycurguſſes,</hi> what bring they? Or from whence? Not from the Athenians, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians; not from the <hi>Romanes,</hi> or <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> and much leſſe from good Chriſtians. Their firſt law is good, and is but for a ſhewe; to colour the reſt. And that is this, ye muſt doe wrong to no creature liuing. But they keepe it ill. For if they carry a ſpleene againſt one; they will giue him a iuſtle, or a ſcorne, or ſomewhat elſe that the other will not take, and raiſe a brawle preſently. The ſecond is if yee happen to wrong one, or that the other take it for a wrong, it is baſe to cry him mercy for it, or yee muſt doe it coldely, or rather ſtand to it, and iuſtifie it, and adde wrong to wrong, and word vpon word to the defiance. No place left for curteſie, but a curteous ſcoffe. A third is, if one throwe duſte or ſalt in your face, or diſgrace you in any ſort: if yee be not a cowe, ye are bound to challenge him.</p>
               <p>A fourth is, that if a man doe not anſwere his chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, the other may ſtabbe him, or piſtoll him for it, whereſoeuer he meetes him. Leſſe then his life cannot ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the diſgrace. What a horrible law is this? How inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane? And yet there bee other as ill as theſe; but they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not all in a tale. I omitte to ſpeake of their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as what is due for the lie giuen, what for a blow
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:150605:72"/>with a fiſt, what with a cudgell? The ſatisfaction muſt be greater then the wrong alwaies, elſe no ſatisfaction, or rather no ſatisfaction will ſerue, vnleſſe the party thinke it ſo. And it comes to this in the end; that he muſt be his owne iudge. For if he thinke it not ſatisfaction enough, all his friends muſt not quiet him. Theſe matters I ſhall deſire you to examine with the lawe of God, and with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of the ſame. And let no man make a puffe at it, if hee bee a man indeede, and not a very Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball.</p>
               <p>There is an eternall lawe, which to aime at, is all our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to ſwerue from is frailty; but to make lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it is plaine Apoſtacie, or as I ſaide before, meere blindneſſe of heart. For what ſhould I call it elſe, when they forget God ſo much, forget nature, forget all ciuility and humanity? A gentleman is ſo called of gentlenes, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to all. The oppoſite of rudenes, ſurlines moroſitie, and hard to pleaſe. And as they be towards man, ſo are they to God-ward; that is to ſay contemptuous and baſe. If the king commaund a man that hee fight not, or if a man bee bound with his friend to the good behauiour, and be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged; he will refuſe for feare of forfeiture, or offending man, and they hold it no cowardice. But when the king of kings forbiddeth,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1. Pſal. 90.11.</note> and his angels are our ſureties, as it is written, God hath giuen them charge of vs; wee neither liſten to God, nor Angell, but turne our backes to them moſt rudely, and therefore they turne their backs to vs, and we ſpeed ill fauouredly with it in the end.</p>
               <p>Neither doth it helpe the iuſtice of our cauſe, to fly our countrey for tryall, as many doe.
<q>Coelum, non mores mutat qui trans mare currit.</q> It ſaues them a penaltie, but helpes no fault, beeing both of one allegeance, which if it were ſeuerall, the ſinne were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God. As it hapned in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, betweene a gentleman of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and the baſtard of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150605:72"/>France, both hired ſouldiers to the king of Armenia. One of theſe had charged the other for taking money of the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh enemy. And beeing to try it by combate before ſome competent Iudge, that were indifferent to them both: They both agreed to goe ouer in to England,
<note place="margin">Edward 3.</note> and to bee iudged by the king there. They would not bee their owne iudges as our Duellors are; nor ſteale reuenge as we doe; nor wrong their Soueraignes, as they had done, if they had beene of one allegiance. But the matter being great betweene them, they prepared themſelues for all tryals of chiualry, on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and on foote, and ſubmitted themſelues to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable cenſure of the worthieſt Prince in thoſe dayes, who iudged it for the Frenchman, after a long combate.</p>
               <p>Yee talke of daring, and what a trouble it is to a man of ſpirit, to be dared to his face in any thing. And why ſhould it trouble you, ſo hee cannot out dare you in true honour. Neither is hee the beſt man that dareth moſt; <hi>Fortis non est qui nihil timet</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) Moſt valour goes not by leaſt fearing. Yea a man muſt feare as well as dare, if he be a true ſouldier or profeſſour of armes. <hi>Vulneribus didicit mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les habere metum.</hi> And yet is not this to bee rightly called feare in him, but a neceſſary care of himſelfe, as farre as may ſtand with honour. The truth is, hee is moſt valiant, that can, and will, and will what ere hee can, due circumſtances conſidered. If your enemy will dare you to the diuell, muſt yee dare to goe with him? And I haue prooued it to bee lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better. If your enemy can clime a tree like a ſquirrell, or ſwimme like a dogge, or haue other actiuities, that you haue not; as to ride a wilde bull, or cloze with a Beare, or bee ſo deſperate as to runne vpon his ſwords point, or leape into a well; will yee anſwer his challenge in any of theſe for your life, though hee dare you, and dare you againe? And yet I cannot deny it to bee a great deale of courage (if a man were not drunke) to dare ſo.</p>
               <p>I knew two gentlemen fell out on an euening, and they muſt try it preſently by ſtarre-light, with either of them a knife in their hand, and had almoſt killed one another if they had not beene found in the fact, and parted. Did any
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:150605:73"/>man commend them for it, or not rather laugh at them? I heard of Sir <hi>John Wallop</hi> an hardy knight of England, who when hee was olde, was challenged into the field by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And it was no diſhonour to refuſe it, and our Duellors will not deny it, but will blame the challenger rather. But the olde knight did challenge him againe to bee bound in a chaire againſt him; as hee ſhould bee alſo, with a caſe of Piſtols in their hands, and ſo to try it. But the other refuſed (our Duellors will ſay) with honour enough. For, may not, and can not, are both in a ranke of things that are not to bee done. Why ſhould a man dare then to doe that he may not without defence, more then that hee cannot without knowledge, or ableneſſe to performe.</p>
               <p>It is pittifull, that men dare ſo, and haue God againſt them. I know well, wee dare euery day againſt God, when ſoeuer wee ſinne wilfully. Wee preſume vpon long life, and therefore wee dare. But to dare him ſo neere death, and in an act, that tendes to death, I holde it moſt deſperate, or like vnto one, that pickt a pocket as hee was going to the gallowes. But whether goes hee? hee goes where he may dye, though man good enough; and his other ſinners may deſerue it, though this were none. What more? He goes where none that feares God will goe with him to giue him countenance. No ſpirituall man will aſſociate him, to giue comfort at his death, or dare bidde him God ſpeede in ſo ſpeedy a way to hell. Hee ſhall haue many no doubt of his owne ſpirit, that will accompany him, and animate him in naughtineſſe; but no man of God to pray for him, or God to take his prayer. Let his cauſe bee what it will bee, right, or wrong. If it bee right, hee ſpoyles it with ill handling; if it bee wrong hee ſinneth doubly. It is baſe to wrong any, but more baſe to ſtand in it.</p>
               <p>Yee aske mee then, what remedy for gentlemen to right themſelues, if they bee wronged, or diſhonoured. I anſwer, my purpoſe is not to giue remedy to remedileſſe humors, but to ſhewe vnto yee, that what yee thinke is remedy, is no remedy, and what yee thinke is honour, is no more but cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. For, yee muſt diſtinguiſh of it thus. There is honour
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150605:73"/>without courage, and that is harmeleſſe; there is courage without iuſtice, and that is honourleſſe, or honours ape; and there is honour and courage together; and that is true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantneſſe, as I haue ſaid ſufficiently before, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an honourable perſon. They that haue breeding, will chooſe the beſt of theſe I doubt not. And as for righting; verily in the law of armes, and chiualry, wee acknowledge no ſuch lawes as your Duellors talke of, but onely one, which is to doe no creature wrong. An other law we haue like to this, neuer to be our owne Iudge. For this we hold to bee childiſh and baſe. Neither is it for a mans honour, to bee ſo ill neighboured, or ill friended, that hee will not bee iudged by any, but by himſelfe. Let theſe two lawes be well obſerued, and men will quickly doe right, or be righted. For it is not vnmanly for a man to aske pardon, where hee hath wronged, ſo it bee not for feare; neither is it honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for a man on the other ſide, to aske vnreaſonable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or to aske ſatisfaction where there needes none; as if a blowe were but proffered onely, and not giuen, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styochus</hi> did by <hi>Hermocrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is fit ſatisfaction for the lye giuen, or what for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſgraces; what is a iuſt repulſe of a wrong, and when the burthen of honour is truely caſt vpon the iniurer, your Marſhals can tell beſt, who are beſt acquainted with this new diſeaſe. New maladies haue new medicines. If a man haue the lye put vpon him, and he ſtrike him for it, I thinke hee ſhould bee ſatisfied. If he take a blow, and giue another, what would hee haue more? for this was <hi>Moſes</hi> law
<note place="margin">Leuit. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus pro oculo, dens pro dente,</hi> An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. And muſt wee haue two for one? No wee may not, for what ſayes the law more? <hi>Qualem inflixerit maculam,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 20.</note> talem ſustinere cogetur,</hi> What contumely hee hath giuen, the like hee ſhall bee made to vndergoe. A diſgrace for a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, a blowe for a blowe, or an humble ſubmiſsion for an vnworthy aſperſion. And yet with vs, theſe be no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We will haue more then the law, we will haue his blood rather. And where the law ſaies <hi>cogetur;</hi> whereby the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is appointed to right vs; wee ſay no, wee will right
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150605:74"/>our ſelues. What a preſumption is this, to teach God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty what is iuſt? Againe, there is much quarrelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout women. If two fall out about a corruptible miſtreſſe, they muſt goe fight for her loue, and know not why. Were it not much more honour, to doe as <hi>Lester</hi> and <hi>Liques</hi> did of late? The more they loued the ſelfe ſame miſtreſſe, the more they loued one an other. Yea when <hi>Liques</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her, and married her one morning, and was taken by <hi>Leſter</hi> the ſame day in a skirmiſh neere Saint <hi>Omers;</hi> and ſhee ſent vnto him to ſend him to her againe out of hand; hee obeyed her voice, as the voice of his generall, and ſent him away the ſame night with honour. And why ſhould not all men doe the like? but ſnarle at one another, like a couple of mungrels, more for luſt, then for loue. In a word.</p>
               <p>If yee will haue of me any remedy, I muſt ſpeake out of Gods law, or no law. And then I ſay if one haue done me a deſpite, that the law will not remedy; yet by Gods law, I may not bee his executioner. Neither neede I ſalute him, or ſpeake to him, or mooue cap to him, vntill hee haue ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mee. I may deny him all points of friendſhip, though no point of charity. Hee hath loſt my good opinion of him, which otherwiſe I owed him. He hath loſt my loue, and good will, and the loue of all that loue me. Is not this reuenge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough thinke yee? but yee will laugh at mee now, all you that know not the worth of loue, and good will. I proteſt vnto you, if I had wronged one in word or deede, it would be to me the greateſt paine that could be. For both muſt I make him amends, and alſo I am bound to ſeeke him, if I haue any Chriſtian blood in mee. If thy <hi>Brother haue ought</hi> againſt thee, that is to ſay, be wronged or thinke him wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by thee;
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>goe thou and be reconciled to him.</hi> Loe heere. I muſt goe ſeeke him where hee is. But I leaue this to preachers, who tell vs, and agree in this; that the wrong doer is bound to ſeeke the wronged for his loue, and that with all the good tearmes hee poſsibly can. And wee haue many examples of Princes that haue done the like.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:150605:74"/>
               <p> A Prince will not wilfully looſe a ſubiects good will for a peece of his kingdome. As we reade of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian Duke, who gaue to <hi>Hypponicus a Senatour</hi> a blowe on the eare, in publique place. But being come to himſelfe, he grieued at it much, and went to ſeeke him next day at his houſe, offered himſelfe to be whipt, beginning to ſtrip; and ſo inſinuated into his fauour againe, with due ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Hypponicus</hi> ſoone after made him his ſonne in law. King <hi>Agrippa</hi> likewiſe hearing of one that thought ill of him for ſomewhat, was not quiet in minde, vntill he had ſpoken with him, and wonne him, made him ſit downe by him, argued ſweetely with him, reconciled himſelfe to him, and ſo ſent him away. Who will holde theſe men for baſe, or not truly honourable, and not true eſteemers of loue or good will? Onely thus much I will adde. Hee that is ſo rude or vnſociable, as to wrong one, and neither ſeekes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement, nor cares what any man thinkes of him, like <hi>Mounſieur Orguiles,</hi> whom we heard maintaine, that hee had rather haue his neighbour to be his enemy, then his friend; ſuch as theſe (ſaith <hi>Morus</hi>) haue more neede of pitty then reuenge, they are halfe way poore ſoules in hell already.</p>
               <p>Neither doe I weigh the common obiection, that our enemy will ſet light by vs, and double vpon vs iniuries in theſe maleuolus times, if he feare no more but loſſe of our loue. Whereunto I anſwer, I will prouide my ſelfe againſt wrong as well as I can. And yet if he feares me not, it ſhall be to me no diſhonour, or harme; no more then if a Beare doe not feare mee, I will ſee to it, that he ſhall not bite me. But muſt I challenge or anſwere the fielde to euery one, that baites mee, or ſcornes mee? So I might ſet vp a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and play the Bull my ſelfe, when I haue done. In a word, I dare approoue no ſauing of honour by fighting, nor any remedy that way. And as touching challenge, I can allowe of none at all; but to ſummon him to the court of honour (if they be gentlemen, and beare armes) to anſwer it at their perill. And the ſentence there may be as great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the wronged, and diſgrace to the iniurer, as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:150605:75"/>that of the Cenſour of <hi>Rome</hi> was. Which Romane gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſtood in more awe of, then of fire or ſword. And this is all I can allowe you, and no more. My reaſon is this. For eyther the wrong is prooued, or not. If prooued, then no combate, as all agree, becauſe there is meanes for ciuill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. If not prooued, as to ſay the lye was giuen you, but you cannot prooue it, conqueſt cannot prooue it, except it ſpeake true alwayes, which no man will ſay.</p>
               <p>Howbeit for a perfect remedy, or preuenting rather of the cauſe, I would wiſh that we were ſo wiſe as to withſtand beginnings, and to temper our heate, that there might bee no brawles at all. For it is a rule in armes, that he who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares ill words, can neuer haue the lye giuen him iuſtly, nor the burthen put vpon him to challenge. Detraction behinde ones backe, and contumely to ones face, are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal bellowes to theſe combuſtions. Or to ſpeake more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to the buſines, I find moſt commonly mens thoughts in <hi>Duell</hi> before their bodies are. Enuy and pride in them fill their heads with compariſons. <q>I as good as he, I more wiſe or worthy, I more valiant or hardy, or of better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert then hee.</q> And this is mentall <hi>Duell</hi> which breakes out into act vpon ſmall occaſion.</p>
               <p>They ſay compariſons are odious, and yet they vſe them as though they were gracious, and that is childiſh. For it beganne with childe-hood, and ſhould ende at manhood. <hi>Quanto maior es, tanto te geras ſubmiſſius,</hi> the greater we be, the more kinde, and humble we ought to bee. And we that bee Chriſtians haue great helpes for it, ouer that heathens haue. And yet haue heathens alſo giuen vs excellent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples heerein; and it is good for vs to learne of them, if wee will not learne of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Wee may learne of <hi>Fabius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> as I ſaid before, not to regard what men ſay of vs, ſo we deſerue it not. Wee may learne of noble <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who ouerhearing ſome of his followers, talking their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of him in the next roome, came out ſuddainely vpon them with a ſtaffe in his hand, and badde them get them further out of his hearing, and then talke what they liſt. Why tooke he not reuenge? We may learne of <hi>Philip</hi> of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150605:75"/>
                  <hi>Macedon,</hi> who contrariwiſe, would not part with <hi>Nicanor,</hi> although he were tolde that hee was ill tongued, and ſpake not well of him. "I muſt looke to my ſelfe (ſaid he) that I haue no fault, and he will haue little to talke of. So ſaide <hi>Tiberius</hi> before hee fell to tyranny. When complaint was made of certaine libels caſt out againſt him; <q>Wee muſt haue patience (ſaid hee) tongues and thoughts are free; I will doe nothing heereafter, but what I can account for; and if they ſhall hate me notwithſtanding, I can but hate them againe.</q> And like to theſe was our <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, who was ſo quallified in this kinde; that he renued the old cuſtome in plaies, and enterludes, to point at mens faults. with quippes, and ieaſtes before their faces (which is death in <hi>

For if a man ſhould wrong him vndeſeruedly, he was his owne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and not his: and if deſeruedly, it was a warning to him to amend. I would to God wee had the minde to learne of him; for he was full of wiſedome, and manly fortitude. He helde it baſe to keepe reuenge in his breaſt to any priuate perſon. In ſo much as going to dye, one asking him what he would haue to his ſonne; "nothing (ſaid hee) but that hee reuenge not my death. And of the ſame minde was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the Emperour, as great a ſouldier as hee was, hee would take no reuenge of priuate enmity. For beeing thruſt out rudely (before he was Emperour) out of <hi>Neroes</hi> preſence by an vſher of the chamber, with theſe words; <q>get you out, get you out with a vengeance, what doe you heere:</q> This vſher comming afterward to him when hee was Emperour, to craue pardon of him to late; hee gaue him no more but his owne words againe, ſaying: "get you out with a venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, what doe you heere. This is baſe to our young maſters now a daies, that muſt beare no coales in no ſort.</p>
               <p>And what doe we reade of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> long before theſe? when <hi>Alcandar</hi> had maliciouſly put out his eye with a cudgell; did hee thinke of reuenge? no contrary; he tooke
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150605:76"/>him into his ſeruice, and hee became his louingeſt ſeruant that euer he had. A ſtrange thing, that heathens ſhould practiſe the Goſpell before they heard of the Goſpell. Yea more ſtrange, that God requires no more of vs, but what our light of nature ſhewes vs the way to. And moſt ſtrange of all, that we who know the Goſpell, ſet ſo light by it, will not heare of turning to 'ther cheeke, or of rendring good for euill;
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> neither doe Ivrge them to it now; and yet theſe <hi>Pagans</hi> ledde them to it, by their owne practiſe, and example.</p>
               <p>Was it want of courage thinke yee, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> would put vp a wrong in an inſtant? As when he gaue his voice for <hi>Memmius</hi> to be <hi>Conſull,</hi> that called him all to naught but a little before, was pleaſed with <hi>Catullus</hi> in an inſtant; and badde him to ſupper, who had defamed him with libels? and who could take more temperately thoſe biting ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Cecinna</hi> then he? Where was courage? where was reuenge? Where letters of defiance? What reuenge tooke our <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> when one was brought before him, that had ſtabbed his picture on the face? This was all he did. He called for a looking-glaſſe, and finding there that his face was neuer the worſe for it, hee let him goe without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Theſe vertues in thoſe great <hi>Princes</hi> were admirable. And although I doe not commend them in all theſe things, in regard they were publique perſons, and might lye open to contempt by it, if they ſhould vſe it: yet are they of great example to priuate perſons, not to thinke ſo loftily of themſelues as they doe, when ſuch as theſe, and ſo farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue them in honour and worth, could forget their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and policie, for loue of theſe vertues, and in hatred of reuenge. It is commended in <hi>Cotys</hi> king of <hi>Thracia,</hi> that finding himſelfe ſo weake as he was in reſiſting anger, hee ſhunned occaſions of it, though it were but to a ſeruant. For which cauſe hee brake once a number of coſtly drinking-glaſſes, that were giuen him for a preſent, ſaying: hee had rather be without them all, then be angry with his man for breaking but of one. Yet much more commendable it had
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150605:76"/>beene, if hee had ſpared the glaſſes, and watched his anger better: which wee that be Chriſtians may more eaſily doe then he, by helpe of grace, which he had not.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen ſhould beſtow ſome time, their idle time I meane, vpon morality and laudable hiſtories, that they may ſee and make choiſe of the worthieſt actions, and imitate <hi>Princes</hi> if they will. <hi>Princes</hi> I ſay, that were not greater (ſome of them) in their outward conqueſt ouer others, then in their inward ouer themſelues. How much better ſhould they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy there time thus, then vpon loue bookes, and poems of idle ſubiect, which haue multiplied, and ſwarmed of late to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the world, to light a candle before the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and to intoxicate mens heads with matter of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent fiction, and ſuch as Duellors are moſt beholding vnto.</p>
               <p>For to ſpeake a word or two of the originall of this vice before I leaue it; how it ſprung, and grew to this greatneſſe: I take it, it comes two manner of waies. One, by ſome likeneſſe it hath to vertue; And <hi>Similitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do mater erroris</hi> ſaith <hi>Galen,</hi> All the world is deceiued with <hi>Similies.</hi> Pride is like magnanimity, and therefore men bee proud; enuy like iuſtice, and therefore men be ſpitefull; gluttony like naturall appetite, and therefore men bee rauenous; letting of money like land letting, and therefore men bee Vſurers. So Duell vpon priuate quarrell, like combate vpon our countries command, and therefore they will fight, when their humours command. The other is a multitude of idle bookes and ingenious deuiſes as I ſaid, but much naughtineſſe in them, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vegle the minde of man, and wrie our vnderſtanding quite on t'oue ſide. Such as <hi>Amades,</hi> and <hi>Ariosto, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alentine</hi> and <hi>Orſon,</hi> and the knight of the Sunne; that are full of theſe challenges, and brauadoes, and ſuch like vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtuffe, which ſome of the Authors haue repented them of ſince, and ſo haue profeſſed at their dying day. Theſe and ſuch like, men teare, and weare with continuall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Euery one will haue one of theſe, or a play booke in his hand, and what men delight in, they are made like vnto.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:150605:77"/>
               <p> An other way how Duell comes in, may be our badde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations alwaies to make good ill, and to corrupt any thing that is good. Religion ſlides eaſily into ſuperſtition, deuotion to ſcrupuloſity, honor to inſolency, ciuill manhood into ranke, and wilde manhood; as hearbes, apples, and flowers doe, which for want of culture, and kindly mould, degenerate in time to weedes, and wildings. The true ſoyle where manhood growes, is lawfull hoſtility, or iuſt defence; for want of which, and through idleneſſe together in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able countries, it growes ranke, and rammiſh, and workes vpon it ſelfe for lacke of the true ſubiect. Like fire, that cares not what it burne ſo it burne ſomewhat; or like a ſton'd-horſe, that for want of a Marrow falles a kicking, and leaping his fellowes, to vent his courage.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeake more hiſtorically; the very beginning of Duellum, and the lawes thereof came firſt out of the North if wee beleeue <hi>Bodinus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Meth.</note> The <hi>Scythians</hi> firſt, a ſtrange people, and of large dominions, who liued all vpon ſword, as olde hiſtories make mention, and doe yet at this day. <hi>Iniurias il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latas rare iure, ſed ferro vindicant,</hi> ſaith <hi>Munster,</hi> They ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome right themſelues but by ſword. And this was ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with their horride nature; that <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> their owne countrey <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> was killed by them for attempting to alter it. After theſe, the olde Germans, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <q>The magiſtrate (ſaith hee) determines nothing either in publike, or priuate, but by ſword.</q> And as this people not knowing God, or his lawes, ouerranne the South with many notable incurſions; and hath left a print of it yet in old Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall lawes: ſo carried they their faſhions with them, and infected all countries with their inciuilities, which would neuer bee quite aboliſhed to this very day. <q>And this is ſuch an iniuſtice (ſaith my author) as I know not a greater; that a weake body cannot bee righted of any wrong, but hee muſt fight for it, though it be with his farre ouer match.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the one diuided into <hi>Guelphes</hi> and <hi>Gibelines,</hi> the other in <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Natifes,</hi> were alſo much to blame in this buſineſſe. And from them it came ouer the mountaines to vs, and wee as forward therein as our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150605:77"/>All bordering countries likewiſe, that liued moſt vpon ſword, rapine, and ſpoyle, as profeſſed outlawes, infected the inlandes in time with their diſorders, and outlawe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty, as the nature of man is, prone to learne that which is euill. But what is the ende of it? See whether it were of God or no. Thoſe nations haue almoſt left it now, and are fallen to worſe, to priuy murthers with long needels, and poyſoning, where they beare grudge; and ſo ſhall wee alſo if wee bee let alone, and a man ſhall not know who hurt him. All artes and ſciences are come at this day to the toppe. Nothing almoſt can bee added. Euen ſo it is with the malice of man, as by this very ſinne is eaſily ſeene. One thing it is to ſinne of frailty as I ſaid, or vpon ſuddaine oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, where mans reaſon hath no time to diſcourſe: but to ſay wee doe well, and are bound to doe it, where we doe ill and will doe it againe, is to forget God quite, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne our intereſt wee haue in our Chriſtendome, or ſhall haue in his kingdome.</p>
               <p>There be lawes againſt this vice in ſome places. But what ſhould there neede lawes to men of honour and armes, who ought to bee their owne lawes, and other mens. Lawes be needfull to thoſe of ruder faſhion. But bee not you like thoſe feeble women the <hi>Miletian virgins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plut. apoph</note> who neuer left killing their owne ſelues, vntill an act paſt againſt them to bee carried out naked when they were dead, for euery man to looke on. Yee haue but one life, and yee haue it not for your ſelues alone, but for many: your friends, and kinsfolke, and countrey haue part in yee, ſaith <hi>Cicero.</hi> Nay, what ſaith Saint Auguſtine? <hi>Quid tam non tuum, quam tu?</hi> What ſo little thy ſelfe as thy ſelfe? As who ſhould ſay, others haue more in thee then thy ſelfe. How vnworthy is it then to adventure thy ſelfe ſo vngloriouſly? Your neighbours, and countrey-men haue part in yee, why ſhould yee robbe them of yee? Your kindred haue intereſt in yee, why doe yee depriue them? Your Soueraigne may neede you, why deny you him his due, and hazzard the beſt blood yee haue in obſcurity? Will other men riſe of your blood thinke ye, when yee are gone? how baſely doe yee thinke of your
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150605:78"/>ſelues in your higheſt conceits.</p>
               <p>A man is borne for many, yet wee will ieopard our ſelues to doe good to no body. One man may kill many in his countries defence; yet wee will bee lauiſh of our life in hope to kill but one, and him as good a member (it may bee) as our ſelfe. And what doe wee in this, but worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſelues? If a man poſſeſſe any thing, there is none but will haue as much as hee can for it before hee depart with it. Onely our life ſhall wee ſet ſo little by, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture for little, or nothing? Doe we not know the worth of our life, and what a iewell it is? how neuer to be had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, when once gone? how ſoone forgotten? how little care of vs when we be dead, and put into a hole, to reuenge our quarrell? euery one is not <hi>Patroclus,</hi> who had an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi> to reuenge him. It hath beene comfort to many, that their death ſhould coſt many deaths. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> died ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of his deadly wound, when hee heard that hee had wonne the field. Wee neither winnne field, nor ſhield by it, but content our ſelues with a little fearefull honour, which is no honour. Wee little remember, that our life is all our ſtocke; and what merchant will aduenture all at once, to make but owne of owne. If I kill, I kill but one, if I be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo, I looſe two. What is gotten by this? if a man had many liues, hee might hardly ſpend one idlely. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing but one life then, and to ſpend it ſo prodigally, I would thinke he had too much of one.</p>
               <p>And I cannot but here (while I thinke of it) digreſſe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from the matter, although not much. And great <hi>Princes</hi> I hope will not blame me, if I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber them of an intolerable abuſe of their <hi>Jraſcible</hi> part, if they take not heede. And their fault therin is the greater, and commoner, the more abſolute their authority is, where no man is to controle them in the power that is giuen them by Gods aſsignment. They are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, or rather put in truſt to bee his <hi>vindices ad iram,</hi> Reuengers for God to execute his wrath vpon thoſe that bee euill,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> and wrong doers, <hi>ijs qui mali ſunt.</hi> I ſpeake not of the power they haue ouer their ſubiects, which is meant directly in this place; but of that they haue ouer their equals in other countries, if they or theirs be wronged &amp; may right
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150605:78"/>themſelues by the ſword if cauſe require. It is ſeldome ſeene, that right is on both ſides. And therfore how many battels we reade of, or heare of, ſo many wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly, yea ſo many maſſacres, or wilfull murthers on t'one ſide, which is horrible to thinke, that it ſhould be amongſt Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Some goe to it with as ſlender pretences as may be. Some with iuſtice enough, but vniuſtly. Our <hi>Charles</hi> the eight will neuer be forgotten, who ranne through <hi>Italy</hi> like a fury for recouery of <hi>Scicilie</hi> and <hi>Naples;</hi> ſet townes and people on fire where he came; robbed Churches and profained them, rauiſhed women, and cutte their throates when they had done. In a towne of <hi>Tuſcane</hi> where they had nothing to do, but to paſſe it through; yet ſpared they not man, or woman, poore innocent people, till they had ſlaine ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hundred of them. How farre was this from <hi>Charles</hi> the wiſe his grandfather, a moſt peaceable and powerful <hi>Prince. Charles</hi> of Burgundy likewiſe had the name of a worthy Prince; yet not to be excuſed for the malice he bare to them of <hi>Leodes,</hi> where he made his ſouldiers carry firebrands in t'one hand, and their ſwords in t'other throughout his army. He left not a ſtone of their walles one vpon an other, to wreake his will on them for a very ſmall cauſe. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Switchers ſoone after, what outrage committed he, where he hung fiue hundred captiues at once without all redemption, brake promiſe foulely with thoſe of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, demanded of his ſubiects a ſixt of their goods, but they would not yeelde him a penny, vnleſſe he would come home, and leaue thoſe idle, (they might haue ſaid) pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous warres. And to goe no further then our next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, what a diueliſh fight was that betweene the Switch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſome of the <hi>Cantons,</hi> becauſe they would not leaue their league with <hi>Auſtria?</hi> They grew to that rancour, and mortall feud, that when they had vanquiſhed them in a ſore battel, they were not thus content, but made ſtooles, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels of their dead bodies to ſit on, and feaſt vpon. And that which is more, they opened their breaſts, and drunke their blood to one an other, and pulled out their hearts, to teare them with their teeth. Would ye thinke this were in Chriſtendome? I giue but a few examples in ſtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150605:79"/>and am aſhamed to tell, what hath hapned neerer our time.</p>
               <p>The like not read of ſcare in all the Bible, that faithfull were againſt faithfull. Yet with vs daily, Chriſtians againſt Chriſtians, and ſuffer their faith to ſleepe the whileſt. There want not prelates, and clergie-men, to forward Princes in ſuch buſineſſe, and to ſowe pillowes to euery bedde. There want not hiſtories great plenty to extoll their doings,
<note place="margin">Ezech. 19.</note> and magnifie their names, for executing brauely vpon their owne tribe,
<note place="margin">Pom. Let.</note> and alliance without all reſpect of nature, and pitty. He that kils moſt is extolled moſt, ſaith one. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is but a dogge to him, if he be angry. And if a Prince be of quiet diſpoſition, and peaceable, and thinkes he hath enough of his owne to gouerne in peace, and feare of God, as <hi>Numa</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> did; they count them ſcarce worth writing of, becauſe there be no battles nor conqueſts in his time. Where contrary, they ſhould thinke him wiſe, for ſparing, and not ſpending ſo much treaſure, and blood vpon that which they cannot keepe no longer, then they be ſtronger, and haue no more title to moſt commonly, then is ſealed with an edge on their next neighbours fleſh. It is a wonder to ſee, what paines and eloquence our writers beſtow in this kinde, to ſet forth the glory they thinke, but indeed the ſinne and ſhame of their countries, if it were not apparantly iuſt, and honourable, which they tooke in hand.</p>
               <p>We reade in the booke of <hi>Iudges,</hi> how ten tribes fought againſt one, which was <hi>Beniamin.</hi> The quarrell was iuſt, the reuenge approoued of God, for a horrible crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in <hi>Beniamin,</hi> and the whole tribe ouerthrowne by them, except a few. Yet when they had done their worſt; <hi>doluerunt,</hi> they were pittifully grieued at it, and <hi>penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am egerunt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudg. 21.</note> their ſorrow was expreſſed in deedes, and care to make them amends, as it their appeares. They vaunted not of their valour, nor made bragges of the blood they ſpilt, but lamented with teares, and with wringing of hands for that was paſt, and could not now be recalled. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes haue wee knowne in Chriſtendome, that haue
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150605:79"/>ſhewne much ſorrow for twenty or forty thouſand ſlaine on a day of the ſame tribe themſelues were of, and bought with the ſame blood? Yea, haue they not made tryumphs and bonefires for it, when they came home, and <hi>Te deum</hi> ſung in Churches for them, when they had more neede of a <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerere?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There haue beene thrice fiue hundred yeares ſince the comming of Chriſt, and the fourth is begunne. In the firſt fiue hundreth began our greateſt <hi>Monarchies.</hi> In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond they grew Chriſtian, and were of great example. In the third they beganne to neglect religion, and to preferre their owne ends, pulling from each others greatneſſe, and abiding no equals, which cauſed much warre. What will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of this fourth fiue hundreth, we know not yet. But if the reſt holde out like the firſt of it now laſt paſt, we muſt looke for a generall reuolt from God and all goodnes,

I haue read an old prophecy, that <hi>Europe</hi> ſhall burne, and it hath prooued true in this laſt age. The rather through difference of opinions, and thoſe both great, and many in matter of Religion. By reaſon whereof ſo many haue beene ſlaine in a few daies ſpace, as would haue driuen the Turke out of <hi>Hungary, Walachia, Tranſiluania,</hi> and out of all <hi>Germany</hi> home to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and in a few yeares ſo many of our Chriſtian brethren haue beene ſlaine by our fire, and ſword, as would haue wholly vncrowned him, and caſt him out of all commerce with vs, beyond the Caſpian ſea, from whence he came.</p>
               <p>Iſpeake not of older times then this laſt hundreth, wherin it bad beene better (if it were Gods will) that <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Netherland</hi> had beene vnder water, <hi>Milan</hi> ſwallowed of the earth, <hi>Naples</hi> flat with the ground; then ſo many liues had beene loſt about them, and ſo many ſoules either dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or indangered by them: the turke looking on the while, and laughing at vs; giuing praiſe to his Mahomet, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bleſſed be our confuſion.

               <p>Laſtly, touching this point of warres, if wee beleeue Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines; a demand of recompence muſt precede for ſauing of blood-ſhedde, before the enterpriſe be vndertaken. Againſt <hi>Turkes</hi> and heathens, wee neede not bee ſo ſcrupulous, ſo touch bee kept with them, and the law of armes. If a king goe perſonally againſt infidels, it is impious to trouble him at home, before he returne; though ſome haue practiſed it, and defeated good enterpriſes by it, to the ſorrow of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, and the enemies great aduantage. I cannot but wiſh, and pray, that God would touch the hearts of Princes with zeale of propagating the name of Chriſt; and if they loue wars, to ſhew their valerous minds where they may ſhew it, and not broyle in ciuill diſcord, and aduance broken titles, and vengeance at home, while the bounds of Chriſtendome in <hi>Europe</hi> grow narrower, and narrower. But what hope of making Chriſtians, if they haue no ſcruple of killing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? I will returne to my matter againe. As Princes haue care of many liues, that they be not loſt, or caſt away: ſo ought Subiects not to be prodigall (as I ſaid) of their owne life, or their neighbours, though neuer ſo enemy to them.</p>

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>BVt I will make an ende. I haue laide before yee after my faſhion, what my ſelfe doe know to bee true, and many by corruption of times are ignorant of. I ſay little of the hurt our countrey hath by ſuch enormities. The State will looke to that, and prouide lawes according. King <hi>Arthur</hi> forbad it his knights particularly;
<note place="margin">Bocas. lib. 8.</note> and ſo did <hi>Alfon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to his knights of the bande, that they might not hurt, or touch one another for any thing: which they would neuer haue forbidden, if it had beene honourable. Whatſoeuer Lawes bee, it is the mindes of men, that I would haue refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in this matter of heate, that lawes may bee obeyed for conſcience, not for feare. To which purpoſe I haue ſhewne yee, how comely and neceſſary it is for all ſortes to carry paſsion euen. How pleaſing to God, agreeable with nature, and gratefull to all that are well minded. As alſo I haue il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated with examples of ſome great perſons, that haue
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150605:82"/>beene bitten behinde their backs, or to their faces, and haue not taken it for diſgracious, as wee doe. And in this point of hot blood, I haue inſiſted the more, becauſe it is the ground. And if this bee well tempered in the beginning, much euill is knockt on the head by it, and wee ſhall neuer goe ſo farre, as to bee our owne reuengers, or to erre vpon colde blood, which yet was the principall ſubiect of my this dayes charge. I haue tolde yee of the commonneſſe of the fault, and how ſinfull, and not onely ſinfull, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall. Inquire of it. I haue prooued to ye how oppoſite it is to the law of God, of nature, of nations, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth alſo the iuſtice,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.32.</note> or law of God; and how neuer practiſed by the worthies of the world, ſcarce read of in hiſtories, not acknowledged by ancient Poets, or commended any where by morall men, yea accounted plaine cowardlines by <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> and much leſſe to be entertained &amp; vſed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: whom I haue prooued to be little better then <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> if they dye in it, and are iuſtly forbidden all Chriſtian bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall; and the ſpectatours, and abetters, are ſubiect to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for it. Inquire of theſe points further, if they be not ſo. I haue told you my opinion likewiſe touching honour, and praiſe of men, and wherein it conſiſteth truely, and how not to be ſought for out of the compaſſe of a mans owne profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Euery man profeſſeth not armes, &amp; as little wit is in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, as manhood in tendring of ſuch a challenge, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be ſword-men. Which if they be, yet to theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I deny the liberty of ſingle combate vpon priuate quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell; beeing neither honourable, what God forbiddeth, nor loyall to Prince or countrey, what mans law diſauoweth, nor the tryall indifferent, that ſtands vpon chance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out necesſitie force vs. Beſides that, I prooued it to bee a tempting of God directly, which how great a ſinne it is, I haue alſo ſaid, and I hope ye will not forget. Although for your better aſſurance, I would wiſh yee to take your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information when ye may, of thoſe that bee learned in diuine lawes, and humane. Who I ſuppoſe will auouch as much as I haue ſaide; and will further beare me witneſſe, that I tye not your honour to ſyllables, or your haughtie ſpirits to words of art; but haue done what I can out of my
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150605:82"/>my loue, to free ye from <hi>Sathans tyranny</hi> in this kind; againſt whom and his workes, and all his powerfull deceites, I profeſſe my ſelfe a perpetuall enemy. For I haue laſtly told yee what blindneſſe of heart this ſinne hath brought vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and what badde lawes come of it, ſuch as it is a ſhame ſhould come from Chriſtians. The originall of it alſo, and the ſtrength it is growne vnto, hath beene opened vnto ye. And finally what a benefit it is of God, to giue vs a liues time in the world, and all the meanes to conſerue it in health, peace, and good eſtate; and yet how vnthankfull we bee in departing with it, or but hazzarding it for a trifle. What God made not without great wiſedome, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, wee will vnmake for a toy or a caprich of our owne. We will goe ſteale a glory by our ſelues, and the firſt ſteppe we make, is into the bottomeleſſe pitte of hell. There is nothing remaining, but that ill cuſtome preuaile not with you, which beares a mightie ſtroake in the actions of men. Ill cuſtome I ſay, that goes handſomely dect in flowers of honour, the more likely to deceiue; and maketh ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presſion in mens mindes, that it will not away with bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Their arguments are, I will not, I cannot, I will be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged firſt, the deuill take me firſt both body and ſoule. For if they ſpeake ſoberly, they bring vs nothing at all, that is greatly worth anſwering.
<note place="margin">7. Mac.</note> Some will vrge me with <hi>Eleazar</hi> in the <hi>Machabes,</hi> who loſt his life to auoide diſgrace, or ſcandall to his name. I anſwer, it is one thing to ſuffer death by Martyrdome, an other thing to be an actour in it, by fighting, which may not be. For howſoeuer the diſgrace be, it is either paſt, or to come. If paſt, it is reuenge to fight, and reuenge is abſolutely vnlawfull in a ſubiect. If to come, we fight for nothing. For that which is to come is not yet; vnleſſe it were vpon aſſault, as I ſaid before. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly if they alleadge the booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> where <hi>Joab</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the challenge of <hi>Abner,</hi> twelue to twelue, and fought it out. I anſwer, they were of ſeuerall allegeance, and in caſe of iuſt warre. <hi>Dauid</hi> had then no more but <hi>Iuda</hi> vnder him; the reſt followed <hi>Jſboſeth</hi> the ſon of <hi>Saul,</hi> whom <hi>Abner</hi> then ſerued: and I often haue tolde you the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150605:83"/>betweene iuſt warre and priuate combate. And if ye thinke this a diſtinction of my owne, without warrant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſomewhat new to ye:
<note place="margin">2. Reg. 1.</note> reade the third of <hi>Kings,</hi> where king <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth it the blood of warre in peace, to reuenge your ſelues by ſword; and gaue iudgement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly vpon <hi>Joab</hi> that hee ſhould dye for it. <q>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer him (ſaith hee to <hi>Salomon</hi>) to dye in peace; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſpilt the blood of warre, or blood (that may not be ſpilt but in warre) in time of peace.</q> And what is it the <hi>Duellor</hi> ſpils, or would ſpill, but his fellowes blood? When? in time of peace. Some there be haply, that thinke it to be ſinne, to fight thus, becauſe all that be godly thinke it. Yet their errour is, that they thinke it excuſable. And that out of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> owne words,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> not vnderſtanding the ſcripture, where he ſaith: <hi>Let no temptation take holde of ye, but humane:</hi> that is to ſay, a mans temptation, a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to a man, and not to a beaſt; a temptation of diſhonor, which beaſts are not capable of, &amp; therfore may ſeem to be excepted or wincked at here by this word <hi>humane.</hi> I anſwer, howſoeuer it may leſſen the fault of the wronged, more then of him that wrongeth for point of offence; yet nothing it makes for their purpoſe. For I neuer heard that place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſuch groſſe and vulgar temptations; but rather as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expounds it, of ſuch as the godlier ſort commit by mentall detracting,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 14.</note> or ſuſpition ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, and ſuch like. Called <hi>humane,</hi> becauſe it is not dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical, as <hi>Lucifers</hi> was of pride or malice; <hi>humane</hi> becauſe it is not of beaſts (as ye ſay) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> luſt or from reuenge; <hi>humane,</hi> becauſe it touches at humane infirmity, and puts vs in mind that we are but men,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> the beſt of vs. <hi>Humanum dico propter infirmitatem,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in an other place. I call it hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſaith he, becauſe of our infirmity, by the which the beſt that are, fall ſeauen times a day, and cannot therefore be meant by Duell, which commonly comes of pride, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<note place="margin">Prou. 24.</note> or baſe vulgar feare; and is neuer ſeuered from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of lawes. And it is ridiculous to ſay as ſome ſay, that if their manhood were knowne once in a combat or two, they would doe ſo no more. Like the woman, that tryed her
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150605:83"/>chaſtity ſo long, till ſhe wounded it. But where doe they liue (trow yee) that thinke ſo? No mans houſe on fire neere them, to ſhew their courage in? No occaſions of manhood neere hand in defence of ſome innocent that is in danger of robbing or beating? Nothing neere them to make their valour and ſpirit knowne, but they muſt goe into the fielde to make it leſſe knowne of all true eſteemers? They vouch the authoritie of <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, for ſatisfaction of the lye giuen. But that makes nothing for priuate Duell; which both that Prince was much againſt, and in his owne caſe refuſed, if we beleeue <hi>Surius.</hi> Yea, none more againſt it, then our <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, a Magnanimous Prince, who now liueth. As by his rigorous edicts againſt this enormity which I touched before, it may appeare. What elſe our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellors can ſay for themſelues, I knowe not. <hi>Marſhall Biron</hi> was to be commended for his valour and fortune otherwiſe, but not for his three to three combate with <hi>Mounſieur Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy,</hi> where his ſide ſlew the other ſide, and was driuen to liue baſely for it, till his father got his pardon, but God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer gaue him a quiet minde after. Hee ſought to witches and ſorcerers, and in the end aſpiring to be Duke of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> a baſe Burgundian ſtrok of his head. Neither are the two combats of late between <hi>Don Philippin,</hi> &amp; <hi>Crequi</hi> in any ſort to be followed. For although they were of contrary allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, noble perſonages &amp; ſtout warriors both of them; the one baſtard brother to the <hi>Duke of Sauoy,</hi> the other a Baron of France: yea though the Duke himſelfe out of paſsion inforc't his brother to it the ſecond time, where they fought deſperately in their ſhirts, and <hi>Philippin</hi> was runne through and ſtucke to the ground: yet the Duke perceiued quickly that he had done amiſſe, and ſent after him with ſpeede, to bring him backe againe, when it was too late. Neither durſt any man there bury him in Chriſtian buriall, as great a man as he was. What further authoritie they can hammer out of diuileſh cuſtome, is all they haue. Good cuſtomes are laudable; but <hi>Malus mos abolendus eſt.</hi> Cuſtome may not make ſinne lawfull, or make it leſſe, but rather greater ſaith <hi>Ramundus.</hi> Leſſe ſeene I grant, and therfore more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:150605:84"/>as we ſee by many examples. How comes any vice to reigne as it doth, and to dance vnſeene, but by daily ill cuſtome? Hath not vſury gotten vp to ſuch an height of ill cuſtome, that many cannot ſee the iniuſtice of it; yea maintaine it to be lawfull? and that is hereſie. How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon are dreadfull oathes by ill cuſtome; ſo as the ſwearer neuer thinkes of it, but rather ſweares that he ſware not. So of drunkenneſſe, ſo of ribauldry and ribauld plaies, where the people laugh not ſo faſt, but the diuell out-laughs them. What ſhould I ſpeake of dicing, tabling, and carding at this day in ſuch exceſſe, either for long ſitting at it, or greatnes of the gaine; night and day, nights and daies ſpent in it, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting health, nature, iuſtice; looſe their time, gaine loſſe and ruine their eſtates. Why ſo? Want they witte? Not, ſo. They doe as others doe. Gallants teach it them, and they teach others. Cuſtome makes it familiar, and all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth cleere with vs vnder colour of company keeping, and nothing elſe to doe, and I doe but as I will be done to. And therefore you, that be ſouldiers, or men of ſpirit, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, if ye be deceiued alſo in your kinde. Euery man is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and tript in his owne humour. Yee know what belongs to fight, but not alwaies when yee may doe it, and when not. Remember ſtill the ſaying of the Athenians, <hi>Nullum inhoneſtum vtile. Themistocles</hi> told <hi>Aristides</hi> a way how to conquer the Lacedemonians, and to bee reuenged on them. <hi>Aristides</hi> related it to the Senate out of the pulpit. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not honourable, they would none of it. So ſay I. Is there ſinne in it? then not honourable. Is there no way to quit our ſelues, but to ſtrike God almighty? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in your aſſaults of anger, what <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> ſaid to <hi>Demochares</hi> the Athenian Oratour, when hee tolde the king, it would pleaſe the Athenians well if hee would goe hang himſelfe. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, the king was not mooued with it, nor touched him for it, as hee might; <q>but willed him goe aske his maſters that ſent him, which was <hi>more honourable, to giue thoſe words,</hi> or to take them?</q> An anſwer moſt worthy the father of <hi>Alexander.</hi> But let vs ende where wee began. My deare louers and friends, let
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150605:84"/>vs neuer be ſo hotte, as to forget to be Chriſtians. And let vs bee alſo Chriſtianlike. And whatſoeuer fault wee haue, as who hath not; yet let vs hate no man, no, not our enemy; but pitty him, and inwardly loue him for his loue, and Pitties ſake, who gaue his hearts blood for his mortall enemies. His loue brought him from heauen to earth; and your loue muſt bring you from earth to heauen. Our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſay, and I beleeue it well, There is no vertue ſuch as this, to indeere vs to God; nor any thing the diuell beſtirs him more in, then to breake in ſunder the linkes, that chaine vs together. Let vs be wiſe in this, or in nothing. Say, we be ſuddenly mooued to breake amity or peace: Yet let it not bee much, or if much;
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> yet <hi>Sol non occidat ſuper iracundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am veſtram,</hi> Let not the ſunne goe downe in your wrath. It will not ill become a redde ſcarfe, and a plume of feathers, to heare the trumpet of God ſpeake. Let not the ſunne go downe in your anger ſaith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, when ye lye downe, lay downe. What muſt ye lay downe? Lay downe your weapon, lay downe all malice and hatred. More then that. Lay downe anger, and all thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. So farre be it from yee, to thinke of challenge, or anſwer in that kind. Vanquiſh your ſelues, ouercome your ſelues, ſhewe your ſelues Gods men, and conquer your ſelues. If ye were hotte in the day, bee coole at night. If yee were haſty when time was, yee haue reſpite to thinke on it, double not your folly with a new daies ſinne. The ſunne is downe, yee muſt thinke no more of it. Haue yee vowed reuenge? Haue yee tenne times vowed it? The ſunne is downe, yee are bound to breake your vowe. Aske your learned, if it be not ſo? Euery time you goe to pray they will tell you, yee muſt lay aſide quarrels. Forget and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue if yee will bee heard of God. Eſpecially, at two times, and then it is ſacriledge they ſay, or ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, to keepe a quarrell in your breaſt. The one is when yee goe to receiue the Sacrament. The other in any likeli-hood of death; be it by ſeruice, or ſickneſſe, as yee may learne alſo by the heathen aforeſaid <hi>Phocion.</hi> Let Duellors looke to this at their perill, that goe to dye, or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150605:85"/>may dye, and carry ſo bloody a mind with them in ſteade of a winding ſheete. Let vs not be harder hearted then <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> in the new Orbe, where the Lords, or Naires would ſtab their ſeruants dayly vpon their leaſt miſcarriage tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards their Maſters.
<note place="margin">Mat 9.</note> They leaue it now, rather then looſe the Church-rites. Euen ſo muſt we do by rancour and reuenge. We may not carry ſuch baggage to Church with vs. If yee bee wronged, I denie ye not to right your ſelues by law, or other meanes lawfull; and if lawes releeue you not, I wiſh they might. But this I muſt tell you. Ye may not looke to haue all that is wrong to be righted heere in this world, or not ſo ſuddenly as your heat, and haſtineſſe many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. If all things were right heere, there were no matter of patience in this life.
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was content with good fame, and badde. The teſtimony of a good conſcience was to him ſufficient. And ye are no better then <hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus,</hi> that died in baniſhment by malice of their enemies. Some are kept from lands, ſome from goods, or good name, and ſhall not be righted till Doomſe-day. And yet if a man haue patience; the caſe is very rare, but he may bee righted heere. But it may bee yee are in haſte, ye cannot ſtay the Magiſtrates leiſure, nor your friendes. And what will ye do if ye be ſore hurt? muſt ye be whole in haſte, or not at all? will ye giue time to your Surgeon for your curing, and none to the Magiſtrate for your ſatisfying? Bee not to earneſt, and hotte in your parly. Be not furious as ſome be, nor giue euill words. A lauiſh tongue was neuer graft on a noble hart. I haue noted, that the worthier the perſons be, the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they be at one. And <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when he perceiued his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemy <hi>Caluus</hi> but a little inclining to peace, he preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him ſtreight, and wrot vnto him firſt. But I make an end. Set God before yee I beſeech yee. Let it not be <hi>nobis vtile,</hi> that is <hi>turpe deo.</hi> And yee may know the foulneſſe of your fault alwaies by your vnwillingneſſe to be aduiſed in it by any reuerend man. I haue beene long; but it may be for your profite, if ye eſcape a ſcourge by mee. Haply yee will one day ſay with King <hi>Dauid,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.</note> Congregata ſunt ſuper me fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gella, et ignorabam.</hi> When ye ſhall ſee your fault, and ſeeke to

But yee haue time now to conſider of it. Once againe remember S. <hi>Paul, Sol non occidat.</hi> Is the Sunne downe? Cry truce to anger, truce to reuenge. Free your ſoules from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and vnquietneſſe. True honour bee your ground. Weare no colours but of God, and your Prince, and relye vpon them boldely.

               <head>THE SECOND CHARGE BY THE CIVILLIAN AGAINST AVARICE.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He noble Philoſopher, and States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Plutarke</hi> hath ſuch a ſaying:
<note place="margin">De ira cohib.</note> that luſt, ſelfe-loue, and cupidity do prouoke much anger in vs, and breede in our boſomes a neaſt of Bees. As much to ſay: they put ſowre in our ſweet, gall in our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, a ſting in our hony; and our beſt contentments worldly are ſubiect to a frette. And to prooue his words true as touching luſt; what gall it is mixt withall, wee neede not ſeeke ſo farre as the deſtruction of <hi>Troy</hi> for the rape of <hi>Helena,</hi> and the warres that were made for loue of her. Wee haue examples enough at home, of thoſe that haue loſt their liues, and limmes for women. And for the other part which is <hi>Couetouſneſſe,</hi> or <hi>Cupidity;</hi> and what matter it giues for anger, and vnquietneſſe; we may well perceiue it, both by courts of iuſtice, that are full of quarrelling for <hi>thine,</hi> and <hi>mine;</hi> and alſo by them that haue more then they can ſpend; yet reſt not ſo content, but ſtill will be adding more water to the ſea.</p>
               <p>Of anger or the part <hi>Iraſcible</hi> (right worthy friends, and gentlemen of great hope) it pleaſed my good Lord to ſpeak very nobly yeſterday; and there is nothing to bee added, though all be too little that can be ſaid, if the <hi>concupiſcible</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:150605:88"/>alſo be not well qualified, and made to know it ſelfe. Of this therefore it comes to my courſe to ſpeake to day, though very vnable for it: and where the laſt daies charge was to quench the fire of anger with coole water; now ſhall it be my endeauour to pull away wood from it alſo, and all combuſtible matter if I can, that there may bee nothing to kindle it.</p>
               <p>And it will no doubt be worth my labour; ſince there is nothing hurts vs more then <hi>anger,</hi> nothing ſtirres vp anger ſooner, then euill guided <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> whereof I ſhall now intreate. And yet of <hi>luſt</hi> and <hi>luxurie,</hi> which is t'one halfe of it, I will not ſpeake, thoſe being ſuch knowne ſinnes, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo little excuſe for them, that their apparant deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth ſhew it ſelfe ſufficiently, without my labour, and your trouble at this time. And they that are entangled with this vice, if they would refraine it as well, as they know it well to be ſinne; they would not (ſure) bee farre from the kingdome of heauen. My charge ſhall be to you, the other part called <hi>Couetouſneſſe,</hi> a deſire of other mens; in latine <hi>alieni appetentia.</hi> And not of all that neither, as of vſury, theft, or vniuſt bargaines, by cheuance, practiſe, coſmage, or deceit, ſuch as lawes doe puniſh and take note of. All theſe are likewiſe ſo manifeſt to a mans owne conſcience, that he needes no other tutor, then himſelfe to inſtruct him, nor yet an heauier iudge then himſelfe, to condemne him.</p>
               <p>My purpoſe only is to ſpeake of one thing, and that is the deſire we haue of too much, which is called <hi>ſuperfluum;</hi> the vnſtinted deſire (I ſay) of more by much, then is ynough, or competent to our eſtate. And for this, as there is no law againſt it, nor can well be, but ones owne will; ſo the will is <hi>commonly in infinitum,</hi> if there be meanes to feede it. It is true, there is no law againſt this, and therefore we muſt be our owne law; the euill of it being as dangerous to our ſoule, as it is vnmarked: and yet we run on with it as moules doe vnder the earth, vntill we be catcht in a ginne, and lye ſweating in our moulten mettall for it in hell, ere we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. God requires it therefore, that we ſhould be our owne law, and that we be carefull herein. The nature of common
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150605:88"/>good requires it. <hi>Charitie,</hi> and brotherly loue in that we be euen Chriſtian, doth alſo require it, and challenge it at our hands. For otherwiſe how come publike weales to allow of priuate poſſeſsions; how doth God reſtraine his hand from the <hi>common good,</hi> to the good of a few; if he put not a truſt in thoſe few, as in his faithfull ſtewards, to diſpence his bountie, and deuide it againe when they haue it; and to diſpoſe it to his fellowes, as cauſe, or neede requireth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gods is the earth, and the fulneſſe thereof.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 23. Pſal. 113.</note> And when God made vs, he gaue it vs to liue of. <hi>Terram dedit filijs hominum.</hi> He gaue it not at the firſt to one, more then to another, but to the ſonnes of men indifferently. And as he gaue them the earth, ſo he gaue them the fulneſſe withall, that euery one might haue full ynough, and no more. And the earth is a large field, and was alwaies able to feed them all that liued on it, and more. And ſo <hi>common-weales</hi> began with equality, and equall diſtribution of outward fortunes, and none to haue more then other. <hi>Noe, Sem, Cham, and Iaphet,</hi> had all betweene them, and their poſteritie after them. The <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> had there <hi>partage</hi> in the land of <hi>promiſe per funiculum distributionis,</hi> part &amp; partlike, as it is written in the <hi>Pſalmes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 77.</note> And that which they had thus, the law was ſo <hi>carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue equalitie,</hi> that they could not <hi>morgage,</hi> or ſell the ſame, but it muſt <hi>reuert againe</hi> to them in the yeere of <hi>Iubilie. Euen ſo amongst gentiles a while.</hi> And when this <hi>equalitie</hi> was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they laboured ſtill to reſtore it, and reduce it if it might be, as by the practiſe of all eſtates throughout the world, and the conſent of law-makers <hi>accordingly,</hi> it may appeare. Such as <hi>Bocharis, Licurgus, Draco, Solon, Romulus,</hi> all tending to this, <hi>to cut of ſuperfluum in many,</hi> and to helpe <hi>pouertie</hi> in the moſt, who haue bodies as well as the beſt, and muſt haue maintenance as well as the rich, and are the Maior part of the common-wealth, yea the principall ſtrength of the ſame.</p>
               <p>For the taking away of extorſion, oppreſsion, and miſery in the multitude, and that all ſorts might liue in comfort, and their <hi>Common weale</hi> happie, and proſperous; they laboured in the <hi>beginning to bring it to equalitie,</hi> thinking nothing ſo fit for their purpoſe, as that. And <hi>Licurgus</hi> herein went
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150605:89"/>further then the reſt, or elſe had better fortune. For in what eſtate hee left the Lacedemonians, in that they continued fiue hundred yeares after, no nation ſtronger, or more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible then they. But when gold and ſiluer came in againe, which hee had vtterly baniſhed; they loſt both valour, and greatneſſe together (as is noted by good authors) and they were no better then other men. When they fell to gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and heaping once, equality was gone, and the ſtrength of the <hi>Comminaltie</hi> was diſſolued with anguiſh and care. For like as the ſtreame of a riuer goes quietly away without noyſe, and ſeekes the leuell without murmure, if it haue no ſhelues to trouble it vnderneath, nor narrowneſſe of the bankes to ſtoppe the courſe of it: euen ſoe it is with the ſtreame of a common-wealth. The channell are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or vulgar ſort, who are eaſily mooued, and runne not euen towards their happineſſe, if the bankes on both ſides, which are lawes, and magiſtrates, ſtand not firme to them, and haue not care to keepe them in their ancient boundes, with paring and ſewing them, as they ought, where <hi>golden ſandes</hi> lye clottering in heapes to gull them vp.</p>
               <p>Equality I muſt ſay had beene good amongſt vs, if it were poſsible to holde. But it is indeede ſo like to heauen, that earth cannot holde it long. It hath ſuch affinity with <hi>Angelicall</hi> perfection, that it will not well reliſh with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane corruption. And therefore in vaine they ſought to eſtabliſh it in any worldly Eſtate. Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> beganne a courſe of equality or community with ſome of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, before hee was a perfect Chriſtian; but it helde not long; his deſigne was diſſolued. Euen ſo thoſe Law-makers, they began well, but it would not continue. The ſequell of ſubſequent ages tels vs, that they conſumed themſelues the moſt part of thoſe great wiſe men, with vnprofitable labour. If mindes bee contrary, how can poſſeſsions bee agreeable? If affections bee oppoſite, how can effects conſpire in equall tearmes? And yet I holde well with their ground, and moſt certaine it is, equality there muſt be one way or other, elſe no common-wealth can ſtand. And this equality I ſeeke for, which heathens could not, and we muſt finde, that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or no people in the world.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:150605:89"/>
               <p> A thing which our great maſter of conſcience Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted, and directed the <hi>Corinthians</hi> vnto,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.</note> for diſpoſing their abilities to them that were in neede, <hi>vt ſit equalitas,</hi> that there may bee equality ſaith hee; as vpon occaſion I ſhall tell you anon, when I ſhall ſpeake of <hi>Superfluum.</hi> For there is a rule of conſcience, which among the vertuous is inſtead of a law, and in liew of equality, and that is this; to cut away <hi>Superfluum</hi> in all men. Keepe your lands, keepe your poſſeſsions to yee, bee they neuer ſo great, or more then others haue; yet put your <hi>Superfluum</hi> out of your handes, and others are euen with yee, that haue leſſe. Put not away what yee neede, but what yee neede not. Doe but imploy it well what yee may nôt holde, and all will be well. This way and no other, will ſoone make equality; euen that which our Law-makers haue ſought for, and could not attaine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spartans</hi> would haue all men bring in there money,
<note place="margin">Plut. in. Lycurgus.</note> and to deuide it amongſt many. But when rich men liked not that, they baniſhed money quite; <hi>gold and ſiluer</hi> made no payment, but lumpes of yron in liew of them, fiue pound of ours in their new coyne, was a horſe load. And as long as this held, there was <hi>equalitie;</hi> but when ſiluer came in againe, <hi>equalitie</hi> went out, and could tarrie no longer. The <hi>Romanes</hi> to auoide inequalitie, and extraordinary greatneſſe in ſome, ouer other ſome, which they ſaw was by incroaching, and buying vp all, that others would ſell;
<note place="margin">Liuie lib. 6.</note> whereby ſome grewe mightie, and the greater part in miſery; they made this law: that none ſhould haue more then fiue hundred acres at once. For ſo much was thought enough for the beſt man in <hi>Rome</hi> to ſpend in his houſe by the yeare. The law was good, but it held not. And <hi>Licinius Stolo,</hi> that made it, brake it,
<note place="margin">lib. 7.</note> and was in <hi>premunire</hi> for hauing a thouſand. Their <hi>leges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grariae</hi> alſo were without number, but their <hi>couetouſneſſe</hi> brake them. By <hi>Caeſars</hi> law a will was not good, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was giuen in <hi>common;</hi> but this beeing forced, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluntarie, it came to little purpoſe, and the Emperour <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi> was driuen to aboliſh it, and left it altogether to mens good willes.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:150605:90"/>
               <p> Other <hi>countries</hi> haue other lawes to fetch it away againe, what others draw to them, and hold ſo faſt when they haue. And thoſe be, to rate mens poſſeſsions for <hi>contribution</hi> to the poore, and other publike <hi>charge,</hi> as they did alſo in <hi>Rome.</hi> Yet this doth but little good neither in moſt places. Rich men fauour one another, and <hi>conceale</hi> there eſtates; and ſo hardly comes any thing from them, and with ſo euill a will, that it can haue no bleſsing, and the poore eſpecially haue little certaintie of it, but chuſe rather to trie their fortunes abroad with begging, then like to attend an vncertaine cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie at home. Many lawes might be reckoned in this kind, but none like the law of conſcience, for true working, and benefite, both to ones ſelfe, and others; and to <hi>conſcience</hi> it muſt be left, when all is done. Which law, becauſe it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be done before it be knowne, and is moſt neceſſarie to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in vſe, and freſh in your memorie: I will open it briefely vnto you, and exhort you to it in the end; cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing of yee for it in liew of my paines, but your beſt attention.</p>
               <p>Diuines whom we ought to follow in matter of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>ipſi enim peruigilant,</hi> theſe be they that watch for vs, and haue charge of our ſoules, that we may doe the beſt, or not the worſt for want of inſtruction: they tell vs many things, that are good for vs to know, if we deſire to bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of our ſafety, and profitable to others. They tell vs firſt, we muſt loue God aboue all things, and this not with loue compoſed of words, but inward, reall, and effectuall; breaking out <hi>per actum elicitum,</hi> as they call it, as fire out of a flint, by expreſſe word, or thought, that may teſtifie to our ſelues, our inward feeling. Some ſuch touch had the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſopher,
<note place="margin">Plato.</note> when he cryed out in a ſweet admiration, ſaying: <hi>O ens entium, miſerere mei,</hi> Haue mercy vpon mee ô thou maker of all things: as if hee had ſeene what hee in in the <hi>Canticles</hi> ſaw,
<note place="margin">Cant 4.</note> when he ſaid; <hi>All faire art thou my loue, there is no ſpotte in thee.</hi> Or what King <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaw in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathas</hi> (which is by interpretation the gift of God) ſaying he was to be loued more then the loue of women.
<note place="margin">2. Reg. 1. Pſal. 6.</note> Or when he ſaide in the <hi>Pſalmes; How admirable is thy name ouer all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150605:90"/>the earth.</hi> And in another place:
<note place="margin">2. King. 1. Pſal. 6. Pſal. 83.</note> 
                  <hi>How inticing thy tabernacles ô my Lord: my heart doth leape to thinke on thee, and my fleſh exults after my liuing God. When ſhall J come and appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of my God:</hi> and ſuch like. Some writers holde, that if a child doe dye after vſe of reaſon, and neuer raiſed to God-ward any act of loue, either little, or much; he can hardly be ſaued. And their breeders are infinitely to blame that put them not to it. For if nothing on our part do bring vs to heauen, but loue; and this loue be ſo cold in a capable creature, as neither inward eie of faith can mooue him, nor howerly benfites can ſtirre him to loue the beſtower; how can ſuch a ſpirit aſpire, where God hath to doe?</p>
               <p>They tell vs next, we muſt loue our ſelues next. And in our ſelfe, are two things conteined. Our ſoule, and our body. Our ſoule we muſt eſteeme aboue all creatures, and we muſt not aduenture the loſſe of it for ten thouſand ſoules. Our third loue is to our neighbour, both body, and ſoule. His ſoule I muſt loue more then my life, and goods; eſpecially if I be his paſtour, and haue charge of him <hi>ex officio.</hi> His life alſo I mây preferre before my owne out of friendſhip, if not out of charity. And ſo I may looſe my life for him, or in defence of the weake, or innocentbody; and this is a great vertue, but we are not alwaies bound to it. Wee are taught alſo, how to loue our parents, wife, children, &amp; which more, if it come to be ſhewne, as in caſe of necesſitie. There is a loue and care due to ſeruants, that they want no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; to maſters that wee faile them not in our duty, or charge. They teach vs to loue our benefactours, both bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ghoſtly, and which more, if it may not be done to both alike. There is a iuſtice, and truth in all theſe. And it is not idle to aske, and know our duty in all. And yet theſe latter may ſeeme more curious then neceſſary; but I come to greater matters, and more neere to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>They ſhew vs further our duty to the publique, and where the common good is to bee preferred before priuate; and where it is in our wils to preferre it or not. And firſt for life, or member, if twenty doe aſſault mee, I may kill them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150605:91"/>all rather then be killed; ſo it be in my iuſt defence, and not againſt lawfull authority. And yet if a man be ſo charitable, they doe not deny, but he may ſuffer himſelfe to bee killed, rather then kill. Whereof there haue beene noble exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, though very few now adaies. And therefore men are deceiued when they thinke they are bound to kill rather then be killed. It is not ſo. They may kill, but they are not bound. Yea on the other ſide, if he that aſſaults mee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly bee a publique perſon, as the king, or any of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I am bound to flye him, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did <hi>Saul:</hi> but if he follow me ſo hard, that I muſt kill or be killed, I am bound to looſe my life, and it lyes not in my choiſe. So of a Biſhop, or ſome other eminent perſon, whom the Common-wealth cannot ſpare; if one boate will not holde both, I am bound to ſlippe out, and leaue my ſelfe to God. Yea they ſay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if my life be ſought maliciouſly in France, and I flye into England for ſuccour, and there is like to be warres for mee, or breach of amity betweene Princes: although the State may not deliuer mee, for that were <hi>tradere iuſtum ſanguinem;</hi> Yet am I bound to render my ſelfe to my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies before publique peace ſhould be broken, or any league in hazzard for mee. Such high regard muſt be had of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good, that a mans priuate is almoſt nothing to it. And with this we ſee how the law of nature concurres. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione</hi> was commended for it, and ſo was <hi>Curtius</hi> the Romane, for expoſing themſelues as they did; the one to bee deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a monſter, the other to be ſwallowed horſe and man in a gaſhfull pit, to ſtoppe the plague, that was then in their citty.</p>
               <p>They teach vs alſo touching goods and poſſeſsions, or any worldly thing we haue, that tendeth to our being, or well being: they be all either <hi>neceſſary,</hi> or <hi>ſuperfluous.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries a man muſt not be negligent to prouide. And it is lawfull for vs to loue them ſo farre forth, as we cannot bee without them, no more then without life. And theſe be in two ſorts, as either <hi>neceſſaries</hi> of life, meate, drinke, warme cloathes, which euery one muſt haue, the pooreſt that is: or <hi>neceſſaries</hi> of eſtate that a man was borne to, or liueth in.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150605:91"/>As if he be a yeoman, thus; if a knight or gentleman, thus; if a nobleman, thus; and the greater the perſons are, the more things are neceſſary, which to the inferiour are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. And all theſe may haue a proportion in our loues. We loue a new hatte, or garment, a faire gowne, or hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome cloake, or what elſe is fitting for vs to weare within our compaſſe or degree. Wee loue a good diſh, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent fare, proportionable to our meanes. And euery man knowes what is meeteſt for him, and beſt ſuting to his ability; euen that the ciuileſt ſort of his ranke doth vſe with <hi>decency,</hi> and without oſtentation, or incroaching vpon the rankes aboue him, eyther man or woman.</p>
               <p>A great many delight, yea too too many in exceſſe, but ſuch loue is naught, and vicious. The backe and belly haue made much worke for Parliaments, and Lawyers euery where. It is an old fault, and the Lacedemonians ſo preuailed againſt it, both for diet and wearing, that the ſubiect neuer excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The Romanes likewiſe had many lawes about expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, called <hi>ſumptuarie;</hi> as the <hi>Aemilian,</hi> and <hi>Licinian</hi> lawes, what they ſhould ſpend ordinarily, and what vpon <hi>Calends,</hi> and feſtiuall dayes. By the lawes <hi>fannia,</hi> and <hi>didia,</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall men were bound to ſpend but ſo much in meate, and no more, beſides hearbes, bread and wine, and that muſt be of the ſame country, and no other. To ſay nothing of the <hi>Anthian</hi> lawe, that was made to barre ſuppers, and other lawes without number, which their outrage of exceſſe gaue occaſion of. There was alſo the law <hi>Oppia</hi> for apparrell, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for women, that they might not exceede in their ſettings out, nor be carried in litters. Yet <hi>Solon</hi> would not haue them walke the ſtreetes in ſolemnitie out of coach; neither might they weare in their eare aboue ſeauenty graines. Their exceſſe ye muſt thinke was very ſtrange, and monſtrous, that cauſed theſe lawes; and there be many ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes in our daies for wearing, but no reformation. I know no good comes of them, ſaue that they argue vs of our pride, and giue vs a learning what is fitte for euery one to weare. Other fruite I ſee none of them, neither force I much.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:150605:92"/>
               <p> I ſpeake onely of the law, that ſhould be within vs, the law of a good conſcience, which is, to know, and doe, and to cutte off exceſſe in all. It ſhewes a weakeneſſe of minde, and pooreneſſe of ſoule, that powres it ſelfe out ſo exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely vpon outward vanities, and pride. For what is it els? they would be great, and are not great, they would bee Queenes, and are not Queenes, yet leaue no ornament for Queenes, but their crowne. I haue heard of a lawyers wife that came before Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in a gowne, and kyrtle of needle work, ſet forth with ſtrawberries, and peſcods of ſilke, and ſiluer. The Queene asked her name; which when ſhe had tolde her, the Queene laught at her, and called her Queene N. I cold giue our women ſome good examples to imitate, which were better then any lawes, if they will. But as the cauſe of this exceſſe is meere pride, and want of witte, ſo the nature of it is, to be worſe for counſell. Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues would be all others patternes, and will haue no <hi>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</hi> Yet men ſhould bee wiſer then they, though womens doteries doe befoole them too much. For what women de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, they muſt weare, and draw women the rather to vnderpeere them. But my purpoſe is not to amend all in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that haue faults ynough of my owne to amend. Yet theſe things fall within compaſſe of my charge; and where they be, they muſt be amended betimes, or deerely paid for.</p>
               <p>All other exceſſes, in hunting, hawking, feaſting, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes, which haue little reſtraint by law, belong all to my <hi>argument;</hi> being as they are, <hi>Cupidities</hi> inordinate, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing loues, if they draw vs to much coſt, and to waſt our eſtates. The eſtate of all men is much regarded and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by learned <hi>Juriſtes,</hi> and <hi>Caſuiſtes,</hi> and therefore they hold two or three things hereabouts, that would be noted. As firſt for almes, that although the precept be generall to all, for <hi>giuing</hi> to the poore, and needie, that are neere them: Yet this is onely vnderſtood, if a man haue <hi>ſuperfluum.</hi> It muſt be out of ſome aboundance, or <hi>ouerplus</hi> that a man hath. He muſt not weaken his eſtate with giuing; which if he doe, it is ſinne. For if <hi>Charitie</hi> bids, yet iuſtice forbids, vnleſſe the neede be extraordinarie: for vertues are not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150605:92"/>contrary, but complying with each other, if they be true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and vſed with diſcretion. My meanes is a thouſand crownes a yeere, and I haue wife, children and family to maintaine in frugall ſort, not denying the reuerſion of my table to the poore. This is my daily charge, and of this I may not diminiſh to giue <hi>larger almes.</hi> And if I go further, it is indiſcretion, and <hi>vicious.</hi> Exceſſe in vertue is a vice, how much more in euill things.</p>
               <p>They hold further, if I be in debt, or decay by loſſe, or want of ſome <hi>prouidence,</hi> which all haue not alike: I am bound to pay <hi>Creditors</hi> aſſoone as I can without notable impayring of my eſtate, and not before: and the <hi>Creditour</hi> is bound to ſtay for it, if there be no fraud in me or intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to deceiue, nor need in the money lender; or if there be, yet they diſtinguiſh of neede. For there is <hi>grauis neceſſitas,</hi> and there is <hi>extrema.</hi> Extreame neceſsitie is of life; as if both of vs want meate and clothing, and I owe him as much, as will buy but one of vs our dinner, ſo as one of vs is like to ſtarue; I am not bound to pay it him. For the vſe of all things is common in extremities, and the law of nature they ſay muſt be prefer'd before the law of nations, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie. Yet this caſe is rare, but in a ſiege, or famine.</p>
               <p>The caſe of great neceſsitie (which is the other ſort of neede) hath beene ſomewhat more common; as if <hi>creditour,</hi> and <hi>debtour</hi> be both in like danger of arreſt, the one if he be not paide his owne, the other if he paie. Some ſay the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour muſt paie, ſome ſay he is not bound. I thinke he is bound if he borrow it <hi>gratis,</hi> but this caſe alſo is not often, that both neceſsities alike ſhould meete ſo iuſt. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſe is, that the debtour cannot paie ſuddenly, and the <hi>creditour</hi> is able to ſtay for it. This is the caſe that troubles many, and wrings the multitude, as we ſee by daily exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. All our learned hold, the <hi>creditour</hi> muſt forbeare, and haue patience, <hi>patientiam habe, omnia reddam tibi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> as he in the Goſpel ſaid to one that he owed money vnto, and becauſe the <hi>creditour</hi> would not forbeare, he was deliuered to the tormentours. The <hi>Sauiour</hi> of the world might ſeeme to call it a choaking ſinne, <hi>Tenuit, &amp; ſuffocauit eum,</hi> he arreſted his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150605:93"/>fellow, and choked him vp in a Iayle, and yet as his caſe was, he had ſome reaſon to doe as he did, and to importune his owne debtour for his owne, being himſelfe in neede, and in danger to his Lord for a great deale more. But my purpoſe is not to proue my <hi>concluſions,</hi> which would aske much time; but onely to informe you of theſe verities; which your learned can inſtruct you in, better then I, if you be as ready to follow them in all your doubts, as they will be ready to <hi>guide</hi> you, and <hi>gouerne</hi> you.</p>
               <p>Take heed I beſeech you, and you cannot be too heedy of this kinde of ſinne. For though lawes were made for the rich, and this was not alwaies law, that all extremitie ſhould be vſed but <hi>hanging,</hi> for recouerie of debts; no <hi>ceſſio in bonis</hi> will ſerue but a mans fleſh, and not a groat ſometimes left him to releeue himſelfe and a poore familie with; which yet the law of nature and nations prouideth for, that a mans perſon ſhould not want out of his owne goods; and yet notwithſtanding, I would not blame lawes or policie for it, if there were ſtore of <hi>conſcience in lenders,</hi> or if lenders would lend <hi>gratis,</hi> as they haue done: Yet remember ſtill the old ſaying, that extreame right is extreame wrong. Is there no meane amongſt Chriſtians? For want of a Tyrant to raigne ouer vs, ſhall we tyrannize one ouer another, or haue power in our hands to do it, if we liſt? If our goods be in our hands, let vs vſe them as we may; if they be out of our hands, let vs get them in as we neede; but let it be done with all Chriſtian lenity; let no choaking or throtling be heard of amongſt vs which will hurt our poore brother, and doe vs no good.</p>
               <p>The Lord I ſpake of in the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> had to do with a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, that was able to pay, yet gaue him day to make mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: we deale with many that be nôt able, and haue nothing to helpe them with but their labour and paines, and yet we caſt them in priſon, take all their meanes from them, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them nothing to keepe them. I ſaid before, if there fault were fraud, <hi>fraus nemini patrocinabitur:</hi> there is no reaſon to ſpare them, that liue by practiſe and coſening. And yet we are not ſo <hi>ſcrupulous</hi> altogether, but that we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our deceiuer. If one ſteale from me priuily, or deceiue
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150605:93"/>mee ſubtilly, or extort from mee vniuſtly, I will ſteale, and wring from him if I can, and doe him no wrong in it.
<q>Fallere fallentem, violat neque ius neque gentem.</q> Prouided alwaies, this bee done without ſcandall, and that we haue no other remedy at hand. But as the caſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon debtors is, that haue no fraude at all in them, and grow behinde hand not by riot or vice, but for want of heede, or beſt aduice; the difference is very great. All that ſhoote come not neere the marke. Some bee fortunate, but more are vnfortunate. Some their good nature hurtes, ſome their negligence, ſome bee ruled where they ſhould not, and falſe hopes deceiue many, without either malice, or euill minde; and may rightly ſay by their outward fortunes, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid by his inward, <hi>ad nibilum redactus ſum, &amp; neſciui,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 72.</note> I am waſted and conſumed to nothing, and was not aware. Yet ſuch as theſe wee puniſh heere, as if they had coſened vs; and if wee durſt bee ſo bolde, we would not ſpare the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of any man.</p>
               <p>Wee are at loſſe by ſuch I grant, but why then did wee truſt? what hope of gaine drewe vs to it? or if not gaine, yet all things wee know are in aduenture; nothing certaine in this world. Wee looſe by ſea, and ſay nothing; we looſe by land, and cannot helpe it; wee looſe by friends and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke many times, and looke for no amends; wee are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to loſſe daily, and more to loſſe, then gaine. And why haue wee not patience then with one that is poore, and not ſo wiſe in the world, or not ſo thriuing as wee? Wee are bound ſometimes to pardon when wee can right our ſelues. Why forbeare wee not then, when reuenge will not right vs? For what is it elſe but reuenge in vs when wee bee ſo greedy? It is not ſeeking our owne by it, which will hardly bee had that way, and therefore what can wee make of ſuch violent courſes, but reuenge? and there wee bidde them lie till they rotte.</p>
               <p>O let vs not ſtand ſo high vpon the ruffes of our fortunes, or coffers thoroughly lined: let vs not conteme our debtors,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150605:94"/>leſt haply wee contemne our betters. God bleſſeth not all alike to the world. Who can tell what will betide the beſt of vs in time to come, or any of ours? Wee are no better then one of the ſons of the Prophets in the fourth of <hi>Kings,</hi> who dyed in debt,
<note place="margin">cap. 4.</note> and his children ſeized, and like to bee ſold for it: and yet <hi>vir timens Deum,</hi> Hee was a man that feared God. It is no ſigne of <hi>reprobation</hi> to owe money, but not to pay when wee haue it. <hi>Mutuabitur peccator &amp; non ſoluet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.</note> The ſinner indeede will borrow and not pay, and is worthily puniſhed. But how many doe we know, and could name, that haue beene ſunke ere now, and ſhrunke in their fortunes; which yet with liberty haue riſen againe to giue contentment, and could neuer haue done it in priſon?</p>
               <p>If reuerend antiquity had foreſeene the hardnes of hearts, and conſcience that now is; they would neuer haue giuen way to ſuch Lawes as they did, that one ſhould tread another vnder foote as they doe. The perſon of a man hath bin much more precious of olde, then now it is, and ſtill is in <hi>Spaine,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if he be a gentleman. It was not ſubiect to reſtraint for debt, no not for debt to the king, but by later lawes. And though Emperours alſo had like law for recouering their debts with more ſpeede;
<note place="margin">Baronius tom. 3.</note> yet <hi>Conſtantine</hi> tooke it away quite, ſo as none could haue their perſons touched but for felony, or contempt of maieſty, or magiſtrate. And thus it was in the beſt common-wealths that euer were, the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Athenians, Spartans, Romans, France, England,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And the noble king <hi>Seruius Tullius,</hi> gaue a reaſon of it, who ſet the olde law on foote againe, <q>that creditours ſhould goe no further then mens goods, and lands. For why ſhould they looſe liberty (ſaid he) who preſerue the common liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with their liberty?</q> And yet much ado there was about it after that, for the ſpace of two hundred yeares. Creditors as they preuailed in credit with great men (which they did too much in our countrey, or in time of peace, when there was no neede of men) got lawes againſt debtors, ſometimes to impriſon them, ſometimes to make them ſerue for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
<note place="margin">Liuie. 8.</note> Which held a great while, till that foule matter fell out between the vſurer <hi>Papyrius,</hi> and his poore bondman young
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150605:94"/>
                  <hi>Publius,</hi> whom he had ſo torne with whips, and rods for not yeelding to his <hi>abhominable voluptuouſnes:</hi> that the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowne, there was preſent order taken by publique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that none ſhould be in priſon, or in bondage againe to <hi>Creditours,</hi> for time to come.</p>
               <p>I heare of ſome now adaies, whom we haue knowne of good merite in their time, ſome of them walking the ſtreetes continually in danger of arreſt, and ſome that ſuffered long impriſonment, fiue, ſeauen, tenne, and ſome twenty yeares for no greater fault then misſpending themſelues when they had it, and no man I ſee takes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion of them. Much better it were for them, to haue all their paines at once, and their <hi>Carcaſſe</hi> deuided amongſt the <hi>Creditours,</hi> as of old it was among the barbarous; then ſo to languiſh in ineuitable miſery, beeing ſtript out of all meanes. And what is this but reuenge vnder colour of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. They ſay nine hornets kill a horſe, and two vndoe a man. That is to ſay the ale-wife and a baylife; or if he bee a gentleman, the vſurer and a ſergeant. How much better is it in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice, Holland, Flanders,</hi> and many other places, where men bee ſet free at the yeares ende, if they prooue vnable; and the <hi>Creditour</hi> in ſome countries beares the charge of the <hi>Priſoner.</hi> Better <hi>in Gran Cayre</hi> the head city of <hi>Africke,</hi> where the priſon-keeper paies the debt,
<note place="margin">Leo. Afer.</note> if he take in a priſoner that is not able. The roote of all this is extreame couetouſneſſe; which hauing loſt the ſword, would beate a man to death with the ſcabberd. Iuſtice hath denyed her the one, yet lets her tyrannize with the other as heauily as ſhee can. But I will proceede with our greater matters.</p>
               <p>Two things more our paſtours teach vs as touching <hi>our eſtates;</hi> the one is of our bettering it, the other is of our carriage in it towards the <hi>Common.</hi> In both which there is a great deale of iuſtice to be followed, and much iniuſtice is practiſed, that lies vnſeene. And firſt for amending our meanes, they holde it a thing to be good, and lawfull, but that we are not bound to it. I holde it a ſure way to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies mending it a little, if wee can, without abating our outward <hi>Countenance,</hi> or neceſſary charge. If it ſo increaſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150605:95"/>and in ſuch wiſe, as hoſpitality increaſe withall, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and vertuous; if otherwiſe, it is naught. It is ſnudging and niggardly and vnworthy a gentleman, or man of ſort. And to this end I approoue their opinions, that ſpend but halfe in houſe-keeping; that is to ſay, in meate, drinke, and wages: and of the other halfe, by that time we be competently cloathed, and haue paid our duties to the King, Church, Poore, and other neceſſaries, to furniſh and better our ſtocke, there will be but little left for much idle expence.</p>
               <p>Neither am I forgetfull of children or of beſtowing them when they come to age; which is alſo a neceſſary duty, and worth our care. Some exceede in it, and ſome come ſhort. To giue great portions with one daughter, &amp; little with the reſt, is not as it ſhould be. Some there be that ſtraine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ouer farre, to match them ouer high. <hi>I am no Solon.</hi> But out of the ſoueraignety that a man hath ouer his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it were good he made two lawes to himſelfe, and if they were binding, it were all the better. One is neuer to giue aboue a yeares reuenue with any daughter; and this were enough to marry them honeſtly, if not honourably. It is a ſufficient proportion, if pride be not; but where pride is, a great deale more is too little. I would not haue them ſo ſtrict as <hi>Solon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plut. vit.</note> or <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> who allow no portion at all for women, more then their cloathes, and ſome other neceſſaries. The other law ſhould be for ſonnes; neuer to pay the ſonnes debt, that were riotouſly ſpent, hauing meanes ſufficient allowed him, and ſuch as he did accept. Or elſe the lawe of <hi>Claudius</hi> were good among vs,
<note place="margin">Tacit. li. 11 Suet.</note> and the like was made by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſpatian,</hi> to auoide all bonds, eſpecially of intereſt, which any ſhould make, or enter into, who were at their fathers finding or liuing in houſe with him. This would be a great preſeruation of houſes, and a ſtoppe to young men for <hi>running riot;</hi> nor would there be ſuch chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon them as there is vpon preſumption of payment. Good nature is againſt this, as it may ſeeme; but leſſe good nature to ruinate ones houſe with vnlooked for leakage. Some prodigall child will be againſt me alſo.
<note place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> But we reade
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150605:95"/>not in Scripture that hee ſpent any more but his owne, his father paid no debts for him.</p>
               <p>Increaſe of our eſtate is many wayes, and euery way vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if we looke not into it narrowly, and be not ſomewhat furniſhed with good counſell, and conſcience. For auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of which danger, it is good for a man to informe himſelfe of truth, and iuſtice in euery buſineſſe; and he that flatters himſelfe heerein, thruſts a ſword in himſelfe, and ſets on fire his owne houſe, though hee liue not to ſee it. They that grow rich on a ſudden, ſhall want bleſsing in the ending.
<note place="margin">Prou. 20.</note> And it is very ſuſpicious that they come not <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to it, vnleſſe it be by merchandiſe, or offices. Land and mony can ſeldome doe it ſuddenly without wrong, and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. It were wiſedome neuer to purchaſe without ſtore of <hi>Superfluum.</hi> It were charity to lend firſt (if the man be poore) before we buy his land of him. But we haue no precept for any of theſe. A man is bound to neither; and therefore I leaue it. Yet charity and iuſtice exact of vs, that we defraud no man of his full price in the purchaſe. Hee is driuen to fell; and when he hath ſolde, hee neuer comes to it againe. God forbid we ſhould beguile him of aught, or make vſe of him ſo farre, that inſtead of lending him, we ſhould worke vpon his neede.</p>
               <p>The learned make three prices of euery thing, which they vſe to call <hi>ſummum medium,</hi> and <hi>infimum.</hi> The higheſt loweſt, and middle price; each price exceeding other by one at the leaſt for land: as if twenty be the moſt, eighteene the leaſt; the middle price muſt bee nineteene yeares pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. Heere they tell vs, wee are bound to giue him eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene for his land: and no leſſe; and the other may take twenty, and no more. I ſpeake after the ordinary courſe of things. For times and circumſtances may be; vpon occaſion of warres, ſcarcity of mony, or fewneſſe of buyers; and the contrary of theſe make it deare. Ordinarily, there bee two notable faults in buying and ſelling.</p>
               <p>The one is in the buyer, the other is in the ſeller, and both proceede of griping, and couetouſnes; and men muſt looke to anſwer for it in an other world, howſoeuer they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150605:96"/>doe vaunt themſelues of their fortune heere. I ſpeake of no darke matters, but what euery one may know, and ſhall haue no excuſe for, when God ſhal one day charge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with blood-ſucking one of another. We are bidden to doe what we will be done to,
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> that is to ſay, wee muſt nôt doe, as wee will not bee done to. The law of nature teacheth vs, how abiect and baſe it is, and I may ſay <hi>vnchriſtian-like,</hi> to lye vpon aduantage as we doe one of another.
<note place="margin">Cap. 27.</note> There is a ſaying in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus: Qui quaerit locupletari anguſtabitur peccatis,</hi> Hee that ſtriues to be rich, ſhall be pinched with ſinnes. And he compares the buyer, and ſeller, to a poaſt in a ſtone wall that cannot ſtirre for the ſtones that ſticke ſo cloſe round about it: euen ſo (ſaith he) ſtands <hi>Couetouſneſſe</hi> betweene buying, and ſelling, that can hardly ſtirre any way for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and pinching our brother. I pray thinke of it ſeriouſly, it is no idle thing I tell you of.</p>
               <p>The fault of the buyer is, to giue but the one halfe for it, or three parts of foure at the moſt. Heere is a whole quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purloyned from the owner. Hee denies not the profite of it, hee miſlikes not the tenour, or aſſurance, or honeſty of the ſeller. But his reaſon is, <q>I haue bought for twelue, I neuer gaue more then fourteene. A bad reaſon; I haue done naughtily, therefore I will not amend. I haue holpen to vndoe ſome, therefore I will vndoe more. But if hee wiſht his ſonne would ſell ſo, he would not leaue him a foote. An other reaſon.</q> He was as willing to take my mony, as I to giue it. True. And ſo it is with him, that giues forty in the hundred. A third reaſon. Land may fall to a low rate, but when? All the mynes are diſcouered, and ſet on broach to the world; people increaſing, neuer more, and land they muſt haue of them that haue it. No warres likely, peace round about vs. And if they ſhould ſell againe, what they buy ſo good cheape; theſe would be no reaſons. They will not ſell for eighteen, that they bought for thirteene. But the true reaſon is, the ſweet they haue by vnlawfull gaine. Ten in the hundred at the leaſt, &amp; moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly intereſt, vpon in tereſt now grown ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, &amp; <hi>tiranniſing</hi> almoſt euery where without controle: that who is there almoſt that hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150605:96"/>and will buy land, where he ſhall not ſee his mony again, in eighteene, or twenty yeares as hee muſt not, if hee doe iuſtly. Where contrary, the vſurer dubbles his hundred in ſeauen yeares all ſaue fiue pound, two ſhillings ſeauen pence. And in twenty yeares, he ſees it fiue or ſixe times double. His hundred is made ſixe hundred, fourteene ſhillings, elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen pence. His thouſand comes to ſixe thouſand, ſeuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, twenty ſeuen pound, nine ſhillings, eleuen pence. And if it come in halfe yearely, or quarterly, it is more. But this is his rate and rule, or no bargaine with him. Hee is not in neede himſelfe, and to'ther is, and muſt haue it at any rate, bee it neuer ſo vnconſcionable. Baniſh therefore this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or common-wealths worme, and twenty pound land wil be worth twenty years puchaſe I doubt not. Where vice reigneth, vertue ſits without dores; and land beares no price, nor fiſhing to the ſea ſhortly where vſury domineers.</p>
               <p>The ſellers fault is to take double for it if he can; thinking euery thing ſo much worth as a man will giue for it. Which is not ſo. The price of land is certaine within a little ouer, or vnder, as I ſaid before, though it bee not ſo of ſtone and pearle. But the iniuſtice of this is, when I make a man pay for his commodity ouer and beſides the higheſt price. It is worth but twenty at the moſt, and I make him pay thirty, or fiue and twenty for it, becauſe it lyes handſomely within him, or is ſo neceſſary for him, that hee cannot bee without it: all that I take aboue the higheſt ordinary, they tell vs is vniuſt, and ſubiect to reſtitution. For I make him pay twice for it. Once for the full value, another for his commodity. As if I ſhould make a ſicke body pay double for a partridge; one for the value, another for the wholeſomneſſe of it. This muſt needes bee extorting, and vicious; proceeding alwaies of couetice, or malice, and yet is growne ſo common, that men will not heare the contrary. To this may bee added Monopolies, or ingrocing of needefull commodities into one or a few mens hands, to make them dearer. Likewiſe to buy or ſell with ſimple or vnexperienced perſons, who know not what they buy or ſell, yet are no fooles. The rule is this. They may buy for the leaſt of the three; and they may ſell
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150605:97"/>againe preſently for the beſt of the three, and make gaine of it, but more then this will not bee warranted with good conſcience.</p>
               <p>The fault of both buyer and ſeller is this, that they ioy and glory in their doings. It is their daily ſtudy, and they take a pride in it. And what doe they glory in? Euen that which will worke them a great deale of woe. Happy is that man, that buyes as hee will ſell, and ſels as he will buy. This is the glory a good body ſhould take; and not in pinching and pulling from his brother.

Is this meant by none but bakers, and butterwiues thinke yee; and not much more by other matters, that ſinke mens eſtates, and make them <hi>groane.</hi> Why ſhould the poore bee defrauded a penny of the full worth, when if a rich man ſell, hee will haue more then hee, by tenne or twenty in the hundred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> who for his ſingular iuſtneſſe was called the <hi>Iust;</hi> defined <hi>iustice</hi> thus: not to deſire any thing that was another mans. So farre was hee from taking, or ſeeking; that he would not ſo much as couet another mans. And how farre are wee from this, who are coueting ſtill, euen when wee cannot haue? <hi>Biblius</hi> was ſo afraide of this <hi>coueting</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that hee would not ſtoope at a purſe, or any thing elſe hee found, for feare of beeing tempted. <hi>In generall</hi> it is good in buying and ſelling, to keepe euen betweene the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or leaſt price, and the rigorous or higheſt price, as your <hi>Aristides</hi> will aduiſe you, if yee will aske. I will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to do as <hi>Hermes Aegyptius</hi> did, a great wiſe man, both learned and rich. Some thinke it was hee that <hi>apologied</hi> for Chriſtians to the Emperour <hi>Adrian.</hi> It is written of him, that hee would neuer buy, but he would giue too much rather; and would not ſell, but hee would take ſomewhat vnder. The like wee reade of <hi>Quintus Mutius</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, who although hee were heathen, yet in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſellers neede, hee gaue them more for their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150605:97"/>houſes or lands which hee bought, then they would aske.</p>
               <p>If wee that profeſſe Chriſtianity were all of his minde, wee would buſie our heads no doubt, with better matters, and more worthy of our ſelues, then how to make gaine ſtill by anothers harme; neither doe I ſpeake this to put ſcruples in your heads, which I am farre from, and I omit them of purpoſe. They be matters of great moment which I minde you of, and as much as your ſoules are worth; no leſſe I ſay, then the breach of one whole commandement, the laſt of the ten,
<note place="margin">Exod. 20.17</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſo much as couet thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours goods,</hi> and this doth binde vs as much as the other <hi>nine.</hi> Howbeit, wee paſſe it ouer lightly, as if it were nothing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in very deede the ſumme and ground of all <hi>Iuſtice</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and man. In other <hi>precepts</hi> the act; here the deſire onely is forbidden, as either to deſire an other mans, who is not willing to depart with it, as <hi>Naboth</hi> was not;
<note place="margin">3 Reg. 21.</note> or to haue it for leſſe then it is worth, as the <hi>Common caſe</hi> is at this day. And both theſe are directly againſt the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet.</hi> And therefore he that drawes from his neighbour in this manner, ſinneth doubly; that is to ſay, in <hi>coueting,</hi> which is a ſinne alone by it ſelfe, and alſo in acting, which is againſt the eighth Commandement.</p>
               <p>It is alſo againſt the generall precept of louing our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our ſelfe, which euery man is bound vnto. For <hi>Qui non diligit manet in morte.</hi> It is damnation I ſay,
<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.</note> not to loue our neighbour as our ſelues. And who is he that thinkes he loues a man, and doth what he can to pull him on his knees? The learned tell vs, there bee foure degrees of loue, which if wee haue not, or haue none of them, it is a ſigne that wee haue no loue. The firſt they ſay is <hi>liquefaction,</hi> that is to ſay,
<note place="margin">Aquinas. 1. 2 ae. q. 28.5.</note> a melting, or a relenting heart towards our brother. The ſecond is a delight we haue to be where we loue. The third is a heauineſſe to bee from our loue. The fourth is feruour, or a burning loue. And although it be not giuen to euery man to haue theſe three laſt, which are delight, longing, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uency: yet none can loue without the firſt, or leaſt degree, which is a relenting, or compaſsion ouer our brother, when wee ſee him in diſtreſſe, and ſell for neede. Surely, if this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150605:98"/>bee loue, it is a congealed or frozen loue, which is contrary to melting loue. It is a colde loue, which is contrary to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent loue. Yea, it is no loue at all; or if it bee, it is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels loue, who loues vs to deuoure vs, and ſwallow vs downe his throat. What we giue our brother too little, would haply ſet him vp againe, and doe our ſelues no hurt. And yet wee loue him ſo, that wee haue no feeling in vs of the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration towards him.</p>
               <p>Howbeit the corruption of the time ſo concealeth this iniuſtice from vs, and hath bredde ſuch blindneſſe in our hearts with continuall <hi>coueting,</hi> that it is now growne from a ſinne, to a very diſeaſe. I know ye ſcanne vpon my words, and I doe not maruell. What? ſhall I not buy as good cheape (ſay you) and ſell as deare as I can? nothing free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then gift; if a man will giue mee his land, I will take it. But how many giue their land, that ſell for neede? Ye may not deceiue your ſelues, nor bee Iudges in your owne caſe. I exhort you to repaire to them that haue skill. And this is the whole ſcope of my ſpeech. Beleeue not me, but beleeue them at your perill. We will not robbe, nor ſteale, nor ſcarce tell money on a Sunday; and ſo long wee thinke all is well with vs. But wee will ſeeke a bargaine to day, that ſhall gaine vs fiue hundred, or a thouſand to morrow; and this is iuſt with vs, becauſe it is no <hi>vſury.</hi> How farre is this from the nature of bargaining, to doe as we doe. The very word of bargaining biddes vs barre gaine, and take but a penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth for a penny. The Merchant aduentures dangerouſly for that hee gets; but this man without aduenture at all, if hee meete with an honeſt man, and his Lawyer bee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe. Yet thus much hee gets, and will get as much more next day if he can, by one bodies neede, or other. O where bee the bowels of charity, that we can ſleepe quietly in our beds,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.15.</note> and our poore brother vndone by vs? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> cals it eating one another. The cry of it reaches vp to heauen, yet will it not reach to our eares. Yea more then this; men praiſe our fortune for it; and wiſhe it were theirs: and I ſhall not haue ſuch fortune ſaith one; and I ſhall neuer haue ſuch lucke ſaith another. A ſweete peece of lucke; when we
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150605:98"/>cannot riſe ſo faſt, but a hundred of others go down as faſt. Haue care of it I beſeech you; I giue it you in charge, that ye may not be vnfurniſhed at the counting day, nor others by your examples.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the things that are bought and ſolde; we muſt thinke the principal thing that is to be had for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is land. Nothing more worth a mans mony, or more truely valuable, or profitable, then good land. Store of land makes great men. Greatneſſe of lands makes kings great. <hi>Terra mater omnium,</hi> The earth is mother, and matter of all things. Whence comes all our ſuſtenance but from crop, and vintage; whence our ſtrength and complexion, but from maid-ſweete in greene meddowes, and three leau'd graſſe? bagges of mony will not bring foorth a roſe; nor heapes of gold make cherries. And where goe we for ſhade in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching day, but to the greene wood? where fetch we fire in cold weather, but from the ſame? whether goe wee to ſee our hawke flye, or follow our hounds, but to hill, and vale, and ſtubble field? galleries, and great chambers will not ſerue our turne. Land fils markets with dainties and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Land furniſhes the ſea with ſhipping to carry out, and bring in. Fiſh is fatte with that comes from land, and the the foules of the aire, with all their variety, are homa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to land for all their feature, and food. If a man haue all the riches and Iewels in the world, what are they good for, but to buy land withall? when wee bee dead, wee ſhall need land, and nothing elſe but land. <hi>Abraham</hi> was rich of gold, and ſiluer; but gold, and ſiluer would not haue buried him, if he had not bought land for it.</p>
               <p>Wee reade in Scripture when God would make his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bleſſed, hee promiſed them land; knowing nothing ſo great a bleſsing in this tranſitory world, as land.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Pulchritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do agri mecum eſt</hi> ſaith he, the beauty of the field is mine to beſtow. Land he promiſed them, and land hee gaue them, to euery one ſome, as I ſaide before. What poſſeſsion is there, that yeelds vs thirty, ſixtie, yea an huudred for one but land, by Chriſts owne words. And therefore I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell not at <hi>Naboth</hi> in the booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> that hee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150605:99"/>with life rather then his land, though it were to pleaſure a King.</p>
               <p>And I ſpeake not this, that men ſhould loue land too much, or deſire more of it then onely competent. Neither is any thing ſo good; but we muſt looſe for God, or ſell to pay true debts, that euery body may haue their owne. But to ſet land at naught, or to ſell it with loſſe, and to ſpend it riotouſly when we haue done, in play or miſrule, without order, or honeſty, as many doe now adaies; is there witte, or grace in it? Is gaudy apparrell more worth thy mony, then land? Dice and cards if they were of gold, are they more precious in thy eye then goodly lands? will thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe maintaine thee when all is gone; or is the ſoking vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer more worthy thy patrimony, then thy fathers child? No. As nothing ſo worthy price, as land, ſo let nothing hold vp the price like land, if we will be good to our ſelues, or to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, as may be eaſily demonſtrated. To be ſhort, there wil be alawies ſome that ſell. And it is free for all to buy that can; vnleſſe it be crowneland; Church-land, or the poores. Thus much for the beſt poſſeſsion, which is land.</p>
               <p>Now for other things that are bought and ſolde; I muſt giue you to vnderſtand, that there is in this no ſmal iniuſtice &amp; ignorance abroad in the world. The ignorant make ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple where none is, for buying honours, and offices. And the <hi>Couetous</hi> make a tuſh at Church-lawes, if they prooue againſt ſence and profit. <hi>Symony</hi> they dare not auouch, but to buy and ſell aduouſons, and right of Patronage, eyther appendant, or in groſſe, or to extort penſions or anuities from incumbents, they thinke it no ſinne. There bee alſo that will not buy a benefice; but they will giue well to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſhall procure it them. To take a gratuity it is lawfull, ſo it be without pact; but to frowne at the gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, if it bee not bigge enough, is no better then <hi>Simony.</hi> To giue money for a ſpirituall ſeruice, otherwiſe then by way of almes to the poore, as for praying, preaching, chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or ſuch like, it is holden abhominable; yet not vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to giue or take for ones paines, and trauell in ſuch buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; or to giue yearely ſtipends for weekely or monethly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150605:99"/>duties. For though no ſpirituall function bee valuable with price; yet ones labour and tye to it is.</p>
               <p>Moreouer to with holde our tithe, as it is a ſinne well knowne, and to take more then is due, is alſo very vniuſt; ſo doe I hold it very infortunate, and ominous to our eſtates (if I may ſo ſay) to bee niggardly in this duty, or to giue the worſt we haue. For God muſt needes be ſparing to vs, and pinching in his bleſsings, if we be pinching to him, and thinke all too good, that goes that way. And to ſpeake my conſcience, although in ſome ſort againſt my ſelfe; I know not how two things be warrantable about this buſineſſe, and yet are very common among vs. The one is in paying <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> or compoſition tithe, when tithe in kinde is worth twenty times more. For though tithe in kind were little more worth when ſuch cuſtome beganne, and the people fewer to bee taught; yet now, the world being riſen to a higher rate, more people to be inſtructed, tenne, or twenty for one; the clergie likewiſe increaſed, rents, and profites alſo aiſed, and all commodities at the deareſt; a poore pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour muſt haue no more but a noble or tenne groats, as he had then, for that which is worth at this day a great deale more. There is a maxime in lawe, that a cuſtome to pay nothing is a void cuſtome; and what is it then to giue little better then nothing; twelue pence perhaps for an angell, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe our Clergie had the priuiledge to buy all things for their mony at old rates.</p>
               <p>The other iniuſtice is in paying nothing at all; and there be thouſands that doe not. Men of trafique, art, and trade, rich, and thriuing, who haue neither corne, or cattle, nor fiue acres land to pay tithe for, if it be a houſe, it is all. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> paid it <hi>Melchiſedecke</hi> of all hee had, euen of that which fell vnto him by ſpoile of his enemies.
<note place="margin">Heb. 7. Lib. 20. Thucid. lib. 3. lib. 5. Gen. 28.</note> The like wee reade the Grecians did to their <hi>Painym</hi> gods, as <hi>Thucidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> and <hi>Iuſtine</hi> write of the <hi>Spartans, Crotoniates,</hi> and <hi>Locri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi> and <hi>Liuie</hi> of <hi>Furius Camillus, to Apollo Delphicus</hi> by the light of nature. <hi>Jacob</hi> vowed to God all manner of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not of this commodity, or that, but of all he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Not that a man ſhould giue of that which lies by him;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150605:100"/>but onely of the increaſe, which comes of mony, or goods imployed in any lawfull negociation.
<note place="margin">Hom. 43. in Cor. Ser. 1. de domin. 12. 1. Cor. 3.</note> For ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who freeth not the very tradſe-man, or artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, nor Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the ſouldier or merchant from this bond of Tithe, if he get any thing by it, though it bee by nothing elſe, but by buying, and ſelling. For it is God who giues the increaſe of both alike, and muſt therfore haue his part in both alike. The law cannot ſay what this man, or that man gaines, and therfore leaues it to mens conſciences. And they are called priuy-tithes, which many good men haue vſed ere now, and I lay no bond vpon you; but wiſh you to inquire of them that be learned; that you may not be found vnthankfull when yee ſhall bee ſummon'd before your grand benefactour.</p>
               <p>Now for temporall offices, I am rather to note the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ignorance, then diſſwade any thing. When we ſee great offices bought and ſolde, which we cannot haue our ſelues; wee make a nodde at it commonly, and cry <hi>Omnia venalia,</hi> as if they were Church offices. Indeed where Iudges doe ſell Iuſtice, and lye open to bribes, there is <hi>Omnia venalia.</hi> And ſo if they deny Iuſtice, or delay Iuſtice for mony, or if they be partiall, and accept of one perſon more then another, we may iuſtly ſay <hi>Omnia venalia.</hi> But there be two ſorts of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. The one of iudgement, the other of execution. This latter there is no queſtion of, being meere temporall, and of profit certaine, and therfore valuable for mony, as houſe and land are. And ſuch be all vnder officers of court, or of Iuſtice, eſpecially if they be for life, or to ones heires. And many of theſe kinds are ſought for, more for countenance and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, then for fee, or profit. For as <hi>Comines</hi> ſaith, ſome haue giuen ſo for them,
<note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> that they haue not ſeene their mony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in fifteene yeares.</p>
               <p>Offices of iudgement alſo are in a ſort valuable. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Emperour <hi>Seuerus</hi> were very ſeuere herein, and remooued them from their places when he came; yet it was rather for their deere buying of offices, which made them ſubiect to bribes, then otherwiſe. For when a fauourite of his did thinke to preuayle ſo farre with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150605:100"/>him as to keepe his office ſtill, telling him that it coſt him deare; yee therefore thou ſhalt looſe it ſaide hee. They that buy deare, muſt ſell deare. And hee would allowe him no more but one yeares profit, and away. The learned ſay it is not onely lawfull for the common-wealth to take money in ſuch caſes, but alſo neceſſary. Lawfull becauſe they take it not for doing iuſtice; but for the profits belonging to it, which is the common-wealths to beſtow, and which they may take to themſelues, if they liſt. Neceſſary alſo for increaſing the common treaſury, which ought not to bee neglected, where lawfull meanes will affoord it. Yet ſo not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that care bee had of a worthy choiſe, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration bee vſed, that they pay not too much for it; both in regard of their yeares commonly, which will not let them hold it long; and likewiſe of their charge, that they be not diſabled by it, to giue countenance to their place, and to maintaine hoſpitality. Haply, the ſumme of two yeares pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit will not hurt them; and after that rate tooke King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the ſeauenth of England, of the Lord Chiefe Iuſtice in thoſe dayes, which I heare was fiue hundred markes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly for buying and ſelling honours, the queſtion is not ſo much of the iniuſtice in beſtowing, as folly in the ſeeking. And therefore I will giue it but a touch. Honour was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a reward of merit; and merit is either of act, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. If it bee of act; as for valour, or vertue; honour is due without money by iuſtice diſtributiue. If merit of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as fauour, birth, riches; it is no new thing to purchaſe honour or armes, as due to their fortunes, by iuſtice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutatiue. And this is called by <hi>Bartolus</hi> a ciuill honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Princes to beſtow, where and when hee will, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon what motiue hee will, and for money if hee will, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him the better for thoſe that merit in act. Yet ſo not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that the better the motiue is, the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the receiuer. The fault or folly is as I ſaid, to ſeeke it without merit at all, or to wrong others that are better then themſelues. The olde rule is alwaies true, <hi>Malo eſſe quàm haberi,</hi> and thus much for leſſer honours. Of greater honours I ſay nothing. For as men are more in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150605:101"/>view of the <hi>Prince,</hi> whence honour comes; ſo better note is taken of their merit. And wee may not doubt but they are well deſerued of a prudent <hi>Prince,</hi> whereſoeuer wee finde them to bee beſtowed. But I leaue this matter, and goe forward with our dregges of <hi>auarice,</hi> if any thing bee to bee ſaid elſe.</p>
               <p>No doubt there is more to be ſpoken of, then I meane to trouble you with. <hi>Contracts</hi> for money, ſtocke, or cattell, let out together, or apart, are infinite. Wherin the learned diſcouer to vs much corruption, whether with ſauing, or looſing the principall; whether with aduenture, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, in nature of pawne, or morgage, or abſolute, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect bargaine or condition, or billes of exchange. In theſe and many other, are many ſhiftes, and deuiſes for profit extraordinary, which paſſe for <hi>currant</hi> daily, yet are vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and lyable to reſtitution. Wherein I doe not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize, for holding you too long. But wee may know them partly, and ſhall haue cauſe to doubt them, and to inquire of them, by the greatneſſe of the gaine; and ignorance will not excuſe vs, when it is groſſe. And two things make it groſſe. One is if it bee like ſinne, or extorſion for the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue gaine: as to get a commodity for fiue, that is worth tenne; why ſhould not a man doubt, and aske in this caſe? The other is when wee haue ready meanes to informe our ſelues by thoſe that bee learned, and will not; but liue cloſe, and worke by our ſelues. Wee aske our ſelues whether we bee able to deale with it or no; wee aske Lawyers for our title, and ſecurity. And where ſhould wee ſeeke for the right, and iuſtice of it before God, but of Diuines? whom God calles his <hi>Angell</hi> by the mouth of his Prophet;
<note place="margin">Mal. 2. Ier. 18.</note> and ſaieth, wee muſt aske his Lawe at their mouth; <hi>Et legem requirent ex ore eius.</hi> And wee ſhould neuer aduenture vpon any thing that our <hi>Charity</hi> doubts of, without their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. Who are as ready at hand for our ſpirituall good, as others are for our temporall. Yet if it bee ſo that doctors doubt of the caſe, yee may practiſe whether ye will; though indeede the ſafeſt opinion be the beſt for vs.</p>
               <p>If it pleaſe you to liſten to them ſeriouſly, remembring
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150605:101"/>alwaies what ſnares hang about you, as thicke as yceſickles in the chill of your <hi>Charity:</hi> beleeue me, ye will finde much good of it. They will helpe you in the very game you play at, that yee may not bee vndone by it. But they will not allow you to play away aboue the twentieth part of your commings in by the yeare. More then this they hold waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or <hi>auaricious.</hi> Not that they know iuſt when it begins to bee ſinne, but by ſome notable decay it makes in your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; and therefore will put a conſcience in you to waſte no more. If the twentieth part bee ſpent, there bee but nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene left. If another part, or t'one halfe bee ſpent, there is but ſo much left, and ſo much weaker yee grow to doe your ſelues good, or any of yours; and yee muſt come to ſell land for it, which they will by no meanes allow. They holde it little leſſe then damnable to play away ſuch a deale in a night, as many doe; or to haue other ende of gaming, then for good companies ſake, or paſsing away the time. And if yee intice one to play that hath no skill, or winne of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant his maſters goods, or of a wife her husbands money, or of a childe that which is his parents, without conſent or conniuence: all yee get thus, is none of yours, but muſt bee reſtored.</p>
               <p>They giue vs a caueat likewiſe againſt <hi>Alchumy,</hi> or <hi>chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mike</hi> art, for the knowne idleneſſe of it, and the apparant hurt to mens eſtates, that haue followed it, and ſpent long time in it; whereof nothing hath come but ſmoake, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and fruitleſſe effects. It is a wonder to tell, what gold and ſiluer it hath coſt, to make <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>ſiluer,</hi> and how many haue bin conſumed by it. Whether it were the charge of workemanſhip, or coſening in vndertakers, or Gods curſe vpon the <hi>auaricious</hi> attempt, eſpecially of late yeares, ſince common experience hath prooued it idle, and the cenſure of Diuines hath declared it ſinnefull: which of all theſe is the true fault I know not. But if they bee true profeſſours of it, they come to beggery in the ende: which our proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent paſtours would not that wee ſhould fall into. This art hath beene much vſed in the kingdome of <hi>Fez;</hi>

               <p>Two ſayings more our learned haue to Lawyers and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnies, and all their appendants, vnder the degree of Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. For of Iudges and Clergy men I can ſay little, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nothing.

The other, if they ſeeke not their owne, but the good of their flocke, both ſpiritually and temporally; what can wee aske more? But of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, and Aduocates it is required; that firſt, and foremoſt they take not exceſsiue fees, nor fee at all, but what they doe ſomewhat for. In a late Parliament of France, they were limited what to take, and no more: which thing ſo diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, that they gaue ouer their practiſe three or foure hundred of them at once, and men could haue no lawe for their money, vntill they were brought backe againe with a deuice.

Neither durſt they very eaſily entertaine a bad cauſe, for feare to haue nothing for their paines.

But the ſecond fault is the greater in my opinion, and that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150605:102"/>is their entertaining, and aduiſing of bad cauſes, or cauſes of ſmal moment. For bad cauſes, I haue known ſome learned men that would giue no counſell with vſurers, or bargaines of vnlawfull gaine. Likewiſe for ſlight matters, and trifling quarrels, that ſtood more vpon will, then reaſon; I haue knowne others, that would not be of counſell with ſuch, nor take their mony by any means. But what the <hi>centumviral</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was in <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his time, to viſit <hi>courts</hi> of iuſtice, and cull out all triuiall actions, and to force men to an end whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would or no; theſe haue practiſed before hand, that they might neuer come ſo far, as to trouble a court.

                  <hi>Bleſſed be the peace-makers.</hi> And this belongeth principally to men of law. So farre be it from them to waite vpon euery mans paſsion for a little gaine; and to boulſter vp mens idle hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors with calumnious billes, and anſwers, and ſmothing of lies, more like to ſophiſters, then men of grauity; and all for what will yee giue mee. Hee that aides the euill in their deſires, is <hi>particeps criminis.</hi> Bee hee counſeller, or courſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Sheriffe, or ſheriffes men, who execute for vſurers, or quarrellous buſie-bodies: Your Deuines will tell you, (not I) that they ſin as well as the parties, and are bound to reſtore.</p>
               <p>The like may bee ſaide of executors to vſurers, and to wrong doers. They be ſubiect to reſtitution as the teſtator was, if they exact, or execute in right of his wrong. To you I may ſpeake it; but to them, I doe <hi>ſurdo canere.</hi> It is in vaine to tell them of it; the world is become <hi>vncapable</hi> of this verity. And of all the multitudes that offend heerein, I can name but one that made conſcience of it. For when they die, they leaue all to ſuch as themſelues, that will not part with a groat, howſoeuer it were gotten. Yet one I knew, who was executor to ſuch a one, and refuſed to adminiſter, but for mee. For I asked him whether hee knew what hee did, or no? <q>Or whether hee had not power in him now to right many? Right ſaid he? Who can tell when all will bee righted whom he hath wronged. He is damned, if any bee damned, and I will not meddle with ill gotten goods. The more to blame you, (ſaide I) you ſpeake not according to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150605:103"/>knowledge. How know you that he is damned, who dyed of ſo good a mind, as to make you executor, that wants neither knowledge, nor will to make all euen, that hee hath done amiſſe. And therefore I tolde him, he ought, and muſt, and ſo he did,</q> and made ſuch a reſtitution as hath not beene heard of in France.</p>
               <p>I may not ſtand to vnrippe all things. Yet one thing more I may not omitte. The law of eſcheates is very beneficiall in this kingdome, both to king, and meane Lords, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in vs much conſcience to free vs from iniuſtice. Our greedineſſe after eſcheates is very ſinnefull, eſpecially vpon matters of life, and death. For in wiſhing the effect, which is <hi>felons goods,</hi> we wiſh the cauſe alſo, which is <hi>felony,</hi> or <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Our paſtours tell vs, it is not good for vs to take all we may by law. But as we be Lords, ſo much wee bee <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,</hi> and haue our eye ſtill at equity, and brotherly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion. He that will take all, is bound to keepe wife, and children ſometimes more then his owne; or elſe prouide for them otherwiſe. For though their meanes be gone, yet they muſt bee fedde. I ſpeake not of open ſinnes in this kinde, as when a man ſhall prie into othermens doings, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen their owne free-holders, and tennants, for loue of that they haue, and not for iuſtice. The rule of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is, that when we be iudges ouer our brethren, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole with them. <hi>Congemiſcat</hi> ſaith he, <hi>et ad pariter conandum ſeinuitet,</hi> Wee ought to ſigh together with them, and to ſtirre our ſelues to amendment, by that in them was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe.</p>
               <p>Much like to theſe are moſt informers, and promooters, who liue vpon forfeitures, and ſpoyle of others. I would haue them know their ſinne, and ſaue their ſoules. I would haue them beeſeruants of iuſtice, and not of curſed lucre. Their wages is commonly a third part, but they make it more then the whole many times. Worſe then theſe are thoſe who vnder colour of <hi>nullum tempus occurrit regi,</hi> Fall to ſearching <hi>records</hi> for olde attainders, and ſleeping recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſances, to intitle the King, or themſelues, and to trouble the ſubiect, ſo farre forth; as hee knowes not whether hee
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150605:103"/>haue any thing of his owne, or no. But ſee their conſcience. For I ſpeake onely of the abuſe. If it be ſo, that they find for the ſubiect, they ſay nothing.

                  <hi>Titus</hi> moreouer to the ende there might be no vſe of them at all, made theſe two lawes.

Another was, that if the <hi>anceſtour</hi> were once dead, and a few yeares paſt, the heire ſhould neuer be charged with old matters.</p>
               <p>I could inlarge my ſelfe much further vpon this ſubiect, if I would open the iniuſtice of euery <hi>particular</hi> eſtate. But partly, they may all be reduced to ſome of theſe I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of; and partly are touched in the penall lawes of euery countrey, which are giuen in charge at aſsiſes, and ſeſsions, for all men to take notice of, that will liue by a law. And therefore let this ſuffice to make you ſee your danger, and the neede yee haue to aduiſe with ſome body; and often to aske about your priuate affaires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your account growe too great, and your clogge too heauie, in the ſight of God.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150605:104"/>looke quite ouer it, and cannot finde it of our ſelues? <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> is the mother of ſinne. If I haue brought you out of the one, ye may auoide the other with more eaſe. And thus much in briefe, for our priuate eſtates.</p>
               <p>Now for our <hi>carriage</hi> towards the <hi>common,</hi> wherein a great part of our duty conſiſteth, and is much-what forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or neglected: I muſt haue a word or two. Where I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget that noble ſaying of <hi>Leonidas</hi> King of <hi>Sparta;</hi> that more we owe to our countrey, then to our owne life. As he approoued right well by himſelfe, and all his actions. I haue tolde you, what your learned thinke belongeth to a good Chriſtian: now heare what they ſay becommeth good citizens, or common-wealths men. That is to ſay ſuch as are good to the common, loue the common, delight in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, and preferre the ſame before their priuate, as I will briefely ſhew you. Yee haue heard what they thinke of life; how little it is to bee regarded in reſpect of common well-fare. Euen ſo they tell vs of our goods, and eſtates, and giue vs one rule in ſtead of all; which I beſeech you to marke whether it be not of God, and moſt worthy our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
<note place="margin">2.2 ae, q. 26.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Jn all worldly things</hi> (ſay they) <hi>which we are bound to wiſh to the common, and to our ſelues, we are bound to preferre the common before our ſelues.</hi> They do not ſay we may prefer; but we are bound, and ſinne if we doe not.</p>
               <p>Out of this rule comediuers noble concluſions, and fitte for euery man to know. I will remember you of ſome few in ſtead of many. I may preferre my ſelfe before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to this houſe, or that manner, becauſe I am not bound to wiſh theſe things to the common. I may ſaue my owne horſe from drowning before the kings horſe, if other danger inſue not, but loſſe of a horſe. It is a common caſe to defende our right againſt the King in lawfull ſort, and to hedge in our groundes from the <hi>purlieus,</hi> if wee haue right ſo to doe, though his game haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint by it. Otherwiſe, it is of his houſe, or palace where hee dwelleth, which I am bound to defend with loſſe of my owne houſe in danger of fire. If my ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe adioyne to the publique <hi>granary,</hi> I muſt ſaue this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150605:104"/>before my owne. My ſingle dammage muſt not weigh with the publike; I am bound to ruine mine owne houſe, to ſtoppe a fire from going further. All ſtatutes and by-lawes made for common good, wee are bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue. And there is a curſe due to wilfull breakers, as is to them that digge vp dooles. Some thinke they ſatisfie with paying the penalty. But lawes were not made for the penalty, but for conformity, that all may draw by a line. Lawes intend not the puniſhment of a few, but the good of all. And therefore all that bee of one common-wealth, muſt haue one ſpirit, and the ſame the Law-makers had. They ought not to ſet light by lawes, nor break them as they liſt, ſo they bee not ſpyed. Yea more then this, we ſhould rather worke our ſelues, and bee ſtill deuiſing for common good, and for them that come after, though wee liue not to ſee it.</p>
               <p>But it is a wonder to ſee, how <hi>croſſe</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> wee be on this behalfe. As if lawes belonged not to vs, when they bee made; or if wee keepe them, it is more for feare, then loue of the common. What a flouriſhing common-wealth ſhould wee now haue, if lawes had beene as duely obſerued, as grauely prouided. Or how would it yet flouriſh, if wee would yet begin, and leaue to bee children in this kind? Where one makes conſcience to keepe a good law, twenty breake it; and then as good no law. There is none will take benefit ſooner then wee, of a high way mended, or a bridge new builded, or repayred. But when wee come to <hi>contribute,</hi> wee drawe backe; or if they fetch grauell for it out of our grounds, wee reſiſt, and ſweare, wee will bee euen with them another time. How far is this from common-wealths-men, or good men either? I will approoue it, hee loues not God, that tenders not common good to his power.

The very Sunne (I thinke) that ſhines to all, we would ingroſſe to our ſelues if we could, and make rent of it. How doe we imitate Chriſt in this? and yet wee doe in this, as we doe in all. We make our ſelues ſtrangers to his Lawe in all things. Wee carry his imitation in our hands to reade of; but wee haue it not in our hearts to make vſe of. Verily, if it were no more, but for imitating of God, and of Gods knowne ſeruants; and though ability were not great in vs, yet our good will wee ſhould ſhew in this duty, and our inclining that way in what wee can. The common-wealth ſhould not bee ſo ready to aske of vs, as wee ready to giue. Common-good not ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to require our ſeruice, as wee ready to proffer, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and glad that wee may ſtead it in any ſort.

               <p>And this if wee cannot doe after the beſt imitation; yet
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150605:105"/>me thinke we ſhould doe it for our honor, and reputation,

The pooreſt can haue no excuſe, as farre as in them doth lye; much leſſe they that be of meanes. Who although they be not ſo wholly for the common, neither is it required as the Romanes were: yet moſt pittifull it is, if not ſinnefull, how hardly any thing comes from them, either for towne charge at home, or for the Church, or King. Touching all which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150605:106"/>as it were our part to bee ſo forward of our ſelues, as wee ſhould neede no rating: ſo they that be learned holde, that when it comes to rating, wee may not hide our eſtates to leſſen our charge, or to lay the more vpon others; which is a common ſinne amongſt vs. And when it comes to paying, it is done ſo vnwillingly, and vnreadily, as if they had mighty wrong in it. I knew a merchant of late, whoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was inferiour to none, his good will was leſſe then moſt mens. I haue heard officers complaine of him, how much they had to doe, and how often they haue attended him for a marke charge, and could neuer get it of him, till they were ready to diſtraine a fatte oxe for it, and then hee turned to his man, and bid him pay the knaues.</p>
               <p>It is a ſhame to tell what ſhifts we make to put of taxes, and ſubſidies when they come, bee they neuer ſo needfull. Diuines tell vs two things about them. One is on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects part, a readineſſe to performe. The other on the Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers part, that it bee not out of couetouſneſſe, but of neede. And if of neede, yet it muſt bee regarded; that the burthen light not vpon the poorer ſort, as the taxe of ſalt did, which <hi>Philip de Valoys</hi> impoſed, making euery man pay as much as the rich. Or to lay tribute vpon country neceſſaries, which wee cannot bee without, or vpon ſeruants wages, or labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers earnings and ſuch like. And if a taxe be doubtfull, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee iuſt or no, or not certaine, wee are bound to pay it, and the publike is to bee preferred (ſome ſay) though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay no; that <hi>melior est conditio poſſidentis,</hi> as it is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes of doubt, betweene party and party.

               <p>And becauſe wee ſpeake of publike eſtates, and priuate; it is to bee deduced out of the grounds aforeſaid, that both common and priuate, are to attend their Soueraignes eſtate; beeing a thing the whole good of a kingdome dependeth on, as much as may bee. And therefore where they holde it dangerous to our ſoules, to haue much lying by vs, as I will ſhewe you anon: Yet otherwiſe in kings, to bee rich and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150605:106"/>well ſtor'd with treaſure, it is both honourable and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp; they can hardly haue too much.

               <p>It hath beene an old prayer amongſt vs; that wee may liue out of debt, and deadly ſinne.

Wee are bound to pray it for our ſelues, wee are bound to pray it for the common. And particularly for the head of the comon. For ſoule buſineſſe as I ſaide before, wee muſt preferre our ſelues before all men. And therefore my rule was, in all temporall good, wee muſt preferre the common. Peace and proſperity which are temporall bleſsings, wee muſt wiſh to the common, before our ſelues. <hi>Pouertie,</hi> and debt are temporall euills in all; but in Princes moſt intolerable. And therefore a kings e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate herrein muſt bee preferred before our owne, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it happens. There, muſt euery mans hand, and heart worke together; there muſt duty, and loue contend which ſhall out-ſtrippe the other; there muſt we apply our wittes, their our abilities, euen for Gods loue, if wee owed our Prince none. How much more if he bee mild, and clement, and one according to our harts, good to all, hurtfull to none. And in ſo doing, wee doe good to ourſelues; the King of heauen will reward vs, though kings of earth neuer heare of our names.</p>

That which our tenants doe for vs moſt readily, though it coſt them their beſt cowe in their yard, to vphold their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord at a neede; we thinke much to do to him, that is Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord to vs all. We ſhould teach heathens obedience, and they teach vs. It is abſurd to ſee how we bee haled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good. We were yeſterday rich, and made our brags. To day when we come to be aſſeſt, we are poore, and make beleeue we haue nothing, or not a foote of free-hold; as one of the richeſt ſubiects in our nation I heard ſay once, when he was charged with a couple of launces.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>O how ſparing would ſuch men bee of their bodies and blood (ſaith <hi>Boccace</hi>) if their country ſhould need it,
<note place="margin">Lib. 25.</note> that are ſo neere themſelues in their worldly pelfe. They ſtretch themſelues farre to beſtowe their daughters magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, rather then ciuilly, and to furniſh a bride chamber for a Prince, rather then for a priuate body. They ſpare for no coſt to ſet out themſelues with ſattens and ſilkes, their wiues with bracelets, an borders of gold, and pearle. Their horſe with trapping, and furniture of the beſt. Their hawkes, and hounds ſhall want no coſt of keeping, and manning, yet can they finde nothing for the common. Fooles, that we are, what will become of vs if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale be in ſhipwracke? What will great kindred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, if the common-wealth faile? How will peace bee maintained, wrongs righted, or priuate good ſecured? Who will there be to giue vs iuſtice, <hi>Quis dabit iura, ſi publicum ceſſabit ſubſidium;</hi> Take away common aide and ſubſidie, and take away all owner-ſhippe from all men.</q> Thus farre he, and more to like effect. It is abſolutely againſt duty, and policy, to doe as we doe, and God will plague vs for both at once. That it is againſt duty, I haue tolde you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and if ye will aske your learned, they will tell you much better,
<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>regem honorificate.</hi> What honour is it wee doe him, or our ſelues, to deny him publique aide, or to ſhrinke in our heades, or to make ſuch beggarly ſuites as we doe, to be diſcharged?</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:150605:107"/>
               <p> It is alſo againſt policy; for wee muſt allow them to bee Kings, and full of <hi>Prerogatiue.</hi> Both Gods law, and mans law giues it them. They are <hi>patriae parentes,</hi> and what the childe is bound vnto towards his parents, we are bound as much to our Princes, and they ſay more. And therefore if we forget our ſelues towards them, when occaſions bring them behinde hand, and they are loth to vrge our vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: can we blame them, if they doe what they can out of their <hi>prerogatiue</hi> Royall, to helpe themſelues? In places where Kings haue no lands, yet they liue like Kings, by their prerogatiue: and if they haue lands alſo, yet they looſe no prerogatiue though they vſe it not alwayes, but at a neede. And moreouer, if ſubiects bee vnkinde, they ſpoile their Princes, and will make them doe many things, that they may, and would not; take all forfeitures and eſcheates, cloſe their hands to all pardons and immunities, incloſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and chaſes, and all their waſtes to themſelues, giue eare to all informers, and promooters, that ſhall any way intitle them, and that which is worſt they will make them ſell and alienate the reuenues of the crowne: which is ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting a thing to a kings eſtate, that ſubiects ought to take notice of it, and make meanes rather for his releefe. Much leſſe ought they to robbe kings, and pull from kings; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they bee officers in any ſort. It is next to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and robbing of Churches, to ſupplant a King. A kings officer had neede to be one of his ioynts, if it might be. For nothing ſo conſolidates the greatneſſe of a king, as truſtie, and true officers; and nothing ſoooner ſinks the ſame, then to bore holes in his ſhip. Remember I forewarne you, if yee chance to beare office.</p>
               <p>If a king be poore and vnable, can the ſubiect be ſecure? Is he not a prey to his enemies, and we with him? Or doe we not know by our ſelues, and our owne debts, how immenſe will his be quickely, if they be not quit betimes? Hee that ſees a king in debt, ſees but halfe a king, to that he is, and would be if he were free. His bounty is ſtop, his rewards ſtopt, and much grace ſtopt, that would flowe like baulme from him towards his ſubiect; and many a good thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150605:108"/>by him, that would helpe and inrich many. If a king be in plenty, all the care hee hath, is, that his ſubiect may haue alſo plentie. But if otherwiſe, all his care will bee for himſelfe, and all the good a king can doe is hindred, or rather buried before it be hatcht. I cannot ſpeake too much of the ſores that doe enſue the indebted eſtate of kings. Our flouriſhing France had a coſtly tryall of it once or twiſe in my memory, and was in great hazzard by it, if timely ayde had not come. Her head-ach made her cry heartily, <hi>caput meum doleo,
<note place="margin">4. Reg. 4.</note> caput meum doleo;</hi> and if God had not helped her when time was, ſhe could not haue beene raiſed againe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miracle.</p>
               <p>Two great faults I note in the ſubiect about this affaire. One is an vnworthy tergiuerſation, or backwardneſſe in him towards the common good, with a baſe conceit he hath, that all is too much that goes that way, neuer reflecting vpon his duty to God, and his countrey, nor to the eaſe of thoſe that bee not ſo well able as hee. Hee will lay all vpon his tenants if hee can, and haue all his rents come in cleare to him. And the richer they be, the further off moſt of them, as may bee ſeene by their carriage. The other fault is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; where if that were done at the firſt, which muſt be done at the laſt, when it is growne double and trebble with linge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; it would haue beene much better; where now it is ſcarcely ſeene. Intereſt increaſeth, and new charges grow, before the olde bee diſcharged; and by that time one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidie bee paide in, two more will not ſuffice. Which puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes alſo the ſubiect more, then had hee drawne his purſe wide, and cleared all at the firſt. And therefore I commend them of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> when <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> came, and impoſed a great matter vpon them, to bee paide at ſixe payments in three yeares; they made him anſwer out of their loue, or height of minde, that they would pay all downe, and ſo they did the ſame day.
<note place="margin">Naucl.</note> I thinke three hundred perſons paide all.</p>
               <p>Once well done, is twice done. But as matters be handled, tenne times done is ſcarce once done. Before the kingſhould fell land, or diminiſh his eſtate; who would not make the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150605:108"/>hundreth part of his meanes, and giue it him downe, rather then make an euery yeares charge of it, as wee doe, and the king not much the better by it? And this would quit a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion or two ſuddainely for once in a kings life time, and doe no man hurt. And how much better this, to giue part ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then all, or halfe, or a third part of ones Rents, as they did to <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> king of <hi>Boheme,</hi> and <hi>Hungary;</hi> and as in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity wê are bound, though God defend it ſhould bee needed. But I haue read of the like in other countries; namely once in Rome, vnder the Conſuls,
<note place="margin">Liuie. 26. Florus.</note> 
                  <hi>Leuinus</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> when there was not a man from the higheſt to the loweſt, who brought not into the treaſury all his golde and ſiluer hee had; and left themſelues little elſe, but what they wore on therr belts and buckles, and rings on their fingers. An other time, they of <hi>Marſeiles</hi> did the like vnasked,
<note place="margin">Iuſt. 43.</note> to aide the Romanes at a need, and left not themſelues a peece of golde, either in publike, or priuate.</p>
               <p>Neither is it fit for vs to iudge the State at our pleaſure, when matter of burthen is propounded, our <hi>Soueraigne</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſe, and bearing conſcience towards vs. They ſitte neere the Sunne, and know what muſt bee, better then wee. They are wiſe, and more experienced then wee, and their part is in the burthen, as well as ours. It belongs to vs to liſten willingly, and performe gladly.
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Hilarem datorem dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git deus,</hi> God loues a cheerefull giuer, and bleſſes him no doubt accordingly. And the reaſon why our anceſtours thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued better then wee, and liued more plentifully, Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> imputeth to this, <hi>Quia deo decimas,
<note place="margin">Hom. 48. de Sanctis.</note> regi cenſum da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> Becauſe tithes they paid to God, and tribute to the king. Others pay alſo at this day, but they doe it not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and God regards more what the heart doth, then what the hand doth.</p>
               <p>And therefore whoſoeuer bee Iuſtices, or Aſſeſſours on the bench; our loue and conſcience muſt bee of the <hi>quorum.</hi> Let mutiny and turbulency finde no place with ingenuous ſpirits. Chriſt himvelfe made meanes to contribute to ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours for our example, hauing himſelfe neither lands, nor goods. And ſo would wee, if we had but loue in vs. A dead
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150605:109"/>horſe is no horſe; no more is dead loue any loue. And where ſhould wee ſhewe it more, then to our Prince, in whom all cauſes of loue concurre together moſt commonly? Some weare their kings in their hat, ſome in a iewell about their necke, and wee ſet vp his picture in our eye where we eate, and drinke; we praiſe him, and ſet out his vertues, and run out to ſee him, and bidde God ſaue him, as if wee had neuer ſeene him before. Wee pray for him in priuate, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; and hee is all our glory till wee come to part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing; and then the king knowes not mê ſay they; I ſhall neuer haue thankes of him, I haue children and charge, the king had more neede giue mee. Some ſay it, ſome thinke it, and wee ſee not who lookes on the whileſt. Euen he that iudgeth both ſubiect, and Soueraigne, and will not ſuffer his annointed vnreuenged of any indignity. But I will goe forward.</p>
               <p>I come now to your <hi>Superfluum</hi> I ſpake of. A thing that is not ill in it ſelfe, if men doe not loue it too much, and ſeeke it not ſo eagerly as they doe. I will tell you in a word what your Paſtours thinke of it, and then conclude. The ſcripture bids you;
<note place="margin">Tobit 4.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye haue much, giue much. Abundanter tribue.</hi> If yee haue little, giue little, but let it bee <hi>volenter,</hi> willingly. Chriſt ſaith,
<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> we ſhall be damned for not doing ſome things. Which all the fathers vnderſtand to be the workes of <hi>mercy,</hi> both ſpirituall, and temporall. The ſpirituall are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in theſe verſes.
<q>

                     <l>Beare with him, pray for him, and forgiue.</l>
                  </q> All which ſixe, as well temporall perſons, as ſpirituail, are bound to doe; eſpecially the ſecond, which is brotherly correction. No man may forbeare to admoniſh his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his offence, if yee bee not more likely to doe hurt by it, or bee likely enough to doe him good, and no body elſe will.</p>
               <p>Which rule alone I muſt tell you, when I well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; it made mee the bolder to aduenture on this daies
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:150605:109"/>charge, though better becomming other manner of perſons then my ſelfe, if they were at hand. But beeing ſo that my happe aboue others hath beene heere to ſpeake about ſuch buſineſſe; although I haue no cauſe to admoniſh, or touch in particular any one for the enormities aforeſaide; yet by the way of praemonition I giue a brotherly warning to all, (as by this rule I thinke my ſelfe bound) that they fall not into the ſame. For according to this rule I finde it written in another place, <hi>vnicui<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>

                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 17.</note> eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man hath charge in charity ouer his neighbour. That is to ſay, either by preuenting euill before it come, as I doe now; or by correcting euill if it bee paſt, which I haue no cauſe in any of you. And this I holde to bee the chiefe, or onely ſpirituall worke, that all perſons alike are bound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. But as for temporall workes which was the other part of my diuiſion, wee are bound to more. And therefore for our better memory, they are put into verſe thus.
<q>
                     <l>Feede, viſit ſicke, redeeme out of thrall,</l>
                     <l>cloath, harbour harbourleſſe, giue buriall.</l>
                  </q> All ſet downe by our Sauiour himſelfe, but the laſt,
<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> which is buriall: and all theſe or moſt of them wee muſt doe vpon paine of hell fire. <hi>Ite in ignem eternum</hi> ſaith hee, Goe yee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euerlaſting fire. For yee viſited me not, ye cloathed me not, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Of ſpirituall workes more then I haue ſaid, I ſay nothing; they belong to Diuines and Preachers; who are the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments with learning, and ſpirit, to mannage our ſoules. Of corporall workes alſo I haue not much to ſay, more then of the inſtrument and meanes for them, which is <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>ſiluer;</hi> and which we either haue, or lay for more then they, and therefore are bound to doe them more then they. For there is not a corporall worke except that of viſiting, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſome charge, and outward ability. Euery body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not redeeme priſoners; yea who make priſoners but rich folke. An hundred dye in a yeare ſometimes out of one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as many ready to ſtarue without ſhirt to their backe, or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150605:110"/>bread to eate. Many are aſhamed to begge, or to complaine and bring in their winding ſheet when they come in, vnable to buy neceſſaries, and much leſſe to pay debts. But this is their manner of redeeming priſoners, to lay them faſter if they can, or to abridge them any comfort, that a priſon may affoord. Let rich men and priſon-keeprs take heede of this, if euer they looke to proſper with that they haue. For if any ſhould periſh thus through their wilfullneſſe, it is murther before God; and if they want maintenance, they are bound by this precept to maintaine them. The rich men (I ſay) for deteining the vnable, if they think them ſo. Priſon keepers for looking no better to their hoſpitalls; for euery Iaile is an hoſpitall, as well as a priſon. And if begging will not ſerue, they muſt finde them bread, and drinke at leaſt, or giue vp their office.</p>
               <p>God will charge vs one day, that wee did not ſome of theſe things, which wee were able to doe, and had good meanes for. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicuique mandauit Deus,</hi> as I ſaid before. And <hi>[mandauit]</hi> implies a duty. It is not as we will, but wee are bound to it; as it appeares by the penaltie which is laid v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it. Elſe why ſhould wee be damned for not doing, if we were not bound to performe? I would haue you to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe matters rightly, beeing the maine point of my this daies charge, which I haue, and am to deliuer you. Ye haue one notable errour amongſt you, that if yee haue hundreds, or thouſands lying by you, you thinke all is your owne, that is left at the yeares ende; and if the world doe follow you a little, yee thinke God loues you ſtreight, and ye beginne to follow it. Then comes in hourding, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and loathneſſe to depart with it. And this, becauſe it is not vſury, or theeuery, and we come well by it; wee thinke it all our owne, when it is not. Remember that ſaying. <hi>Qui feſtinat ditari, non erit innocens,</hi> Hee that haſteneth to bee rich,
<note place="margin">Prou. 28.</note> can hardly bee innocent. For eyther hee comes not well by it as hee ſhould, or vſeth it not well when hee hath it, or thinkes all to bee his owne, and forgettes his Stewardſhip.</p>
               <p>We thinke all to bee our owne I ſay, and ſo it is againſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150605:110"/>all men but God, and the poore. If the poore want, it is none of ours. Howbeit, ſuch be the times, and ſo far be we growne from the true conceipt of this duty, that wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make but a tuſh at it. They knew it better in the <hi>primitiue Church,</hi> then now we doe; as appeared by the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary contributions, and often gatherings for the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and them that wanted. They were called <hi>Collectae,</hi> and were paid moſt readily without long asking. But afterward as deuotion grew ſlacke, Biſhops were driuen to ſend out their warrants to compell them to charity. And in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, there be temporall lawes to inforce vs to ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a worke. Wee are driuen to pay by the acre, and yet it comes full hardly from vs for want of true knowledge of our bond on this behalfe. Which neceſſary knowledge, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo neceſſary as any can be, I would reſuſcitate as it were, and raiſe againe in our ſoules, and ſpirits, that wee may not periſh for want of this loue, and pious affection. Which God himſelfe not counſelleth but commandeth, not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth but exacteth, not aduiſeth but ſtrictly chargeth vs, that it doe not decay in vs, but bee alwayes burning.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith there is no loue in vs,
<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.</note> if we haue the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the world, and will ſee our brother want. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde heere a flat iudgement againſt vs, and yet wee thinke our ſelues ſecure hauing ſtore by vs, and will not part with it. We cân helpe, and will not, wee haue the ſubſtance of the world, and yet wee will ſee him want. Yee haue heard already, that whatſoeuer our profeſſion be, wee muſt not be aſhamed of the Goſpell; our <hi>Glory</hi> muſt be in Gods holy word. We are bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue one another. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the diuine of diuines ſaith plainely, <hi>Wee loue not,</hi> if wee haue the ſubſtance, and powre it not forth. And what followes then but loſſe of our ſoules. It is not I that giues the cenſure, but the written word giues it, and it will not be auoided. If wee keepe our ſubſtance to our ſoules, we loue not,
<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.1.</note> if we loue not we ſhall not liue. And this S. <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe ſaith, he writes vnto them, to the ende they may not ſin. What <hi>glory</hi> now in your <hi>ſuperfluum?</hi> what glory in your abundance? what glory in your ſubſtance, if it be prouided you to damne you?</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:150605:111"/>
               <p> Let vs come now to our deuines, and beſt expoſiters. And ſee whether thêy will helpe vs? No. They ſing all one ſong. The word of God is eternall, ſooths no man, is ſubiect to no mutation. It was ſo in the beginning, and muſt be ſo to the ending. They tell vs firſt out of the <hi>prophecy</hi> of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> that the poore <hi>we ſhall haue alwayes with vs.</hi> And there be reaſons for it, beſides <hi>authority.</hi> The firſt reaſon is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. For the poore come neereſt the nature, and faſhion of the firſt age, when all were in equality, all cladde alike, all in like buſineſſe of husbandry, and bodily labour, without diſtinction of nobility and popularity, riches and pouerty, as was moſt <hi>congruent</hi> to the law of nature; and ſo haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from age to age to this very day, the trueſt patterne of our primitiue eſtate, or golden world. And therefore we may not contemne them,
<note place="margin">Thucid. 2.</note> or thinke their eſtate ſhamefull. For it is no ſhame to be poore (ſaid <hi>Pericles</hi>) but to be idle, and doe nothing whereby to liue.</p>
               <p>An other reaſon is the corrupt nature of man, who ſtriues to drawe all to him, and would leaue his fellowes little, if he could. Like them that play at dice, where one gettes all with his fortune or falſhood, and leaues the reſt pennileſſe. A third reaſon is morall, or politicall. For the poore are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and were it not for them, wee ſhould doe our worke our ſelues. Alſo many of theſe be weake, lame, blind, aged, or ſickely, and cannot worke. A fourth reaſon is ſupernaturall. For if there were no poore, there would not be ſuch matter of charity, or ſuch ſtore of it, as there is dayly amongſt vs. And charity is one of the Theologicall vertues commended to vs often in Scriptures, and without which we know not whether we loue God or no. For it is a notable ſigne that we loue God, when we loue the poore for God.</p>
               <p>In which reſpect, not to deny the poore alſo their due commendation, and to acknowledge the good wee receiue by their meanes; there needs no other teſtimony of it, then the promiſed bleſsings belonging thereunto, out of holy writ.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>Beatus homo,</hi> 
                  <q>Bleſſed is he, that lookes vpon the poore, and needy; God will deliuer him in the euill day. God will keepe him from his enemies, and will help him, at his houre
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150605:111"/>of death.</q> Theſe be high benefits. And in another place,

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150605:112"/>
                  <hi>Superfluum,</hi> as they did before of neceſſaries. For as there bee neceſſaries of nature, for keeping one aliue onely, with broken meate and patcht cloathes; and neceſſaries of eſtate, which are cloathes, and dwelling conuenient: ſo bee there alſo ſuperfluous of nature, when a man hath more then will ſuffice nature; and ſuperfluous of eſtate, and perſon, when hee hath more then hee hath preſent neede of for his eſtate, and perſon.</p>
               <p>A poore man for example hath meate, and torne cloathes about him, but not to keepe him ſweete, and wholeſome; here is nature ſerued, but no <hi>conueniency.</hi> An other hath <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient</hi> cloathing and abode, but wantes worke, or meanes to ſet vp trade; heere is another neceſſity ſupplyed, but not the third, for he muſt not liue idlely. The firſt is moſt-what ſupplyed at euery mans dore out of their <hi>Superfluum</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And if they cannot ſupply it otherwiſe, they muſt make <hi>Superfluum,</hi> and eate leſſe, rather then a poore creature ſhould ſtarue at his dore. The ſecond is a great neceſſity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and muſt bee ſupplied out of ſome little <hi>Superfluum</hi> of our eſtate; and ſome haue giuen their cloakes off their backes at ſuch a neede, and haue beene greatly bleſt for it. The third which are ordinary neceſſities, they holde we are not bound to ſupply, vnleſſe wee haue ſome ſtore of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluum.</hi> So as if wee haue more then enough for our ſelues, wee are bound to ſupply thoſe ordinary neceſsaries in thêm, whom wee ſee, or heare doe neede. <hi>Idcirco te voluit abunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Deus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Leo) vt per te alius non egeat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the doctrine which your learned vpon very good grounds doe holde, and teach. And when they ſpeake thus of <hi>Superfluum</hi> or ouerplus, their meaning is of that onely which we poſſeſſe ouer and aboue that which is needefull to our moſt decent eſtate we liue in. All that, they ſay we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call ours, and it muſt not bee retained, but it muſt bee imployed in ſome good and pyous vſes, or to ſupply the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wants of others. Neither doth this bond of ours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe they ſay, out of the neceſsity of the poore onely, as in almes it doth, where the neede is extreame;
<note place="margin">2. 2 ae. q. 32. ad 5.</note> but out of the very nature of <hi>Superfluum,</hi> and Iuſtice diſtributiue; whereof
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150605:113"/>By this onely title wee become diſpenſers, becauſe it is more then we neede our ſelues. And ſo much Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuateth vnto vs,
<note place="margin">Tract. 50. in Ioh.</note> both by the place aforeſaid; and alſo in another place, ſaying: <hi>tibi ſuperflua, domino neceſſaria.</hi> As who ſhould ſay becauſe thou needeſt them not thy ſelfe, they are God almighties, who hath infinite vſe of them in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Many a younger brother borne to little or nothing, would bee thy champion, or beadſman, for a little of that which thou couldeſt ſpare. Many a poore gentleman decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by loſſe, or misfortune, would hold vp his hands day and night for thee. Some ruinated houſe might riſe againe by thee, and giue thee the ſtile of her founder, and rayſer. Much euill is in the world, and many badde, courſes attend good natures through onely want; which a caſt of thy pittifull eye might eaſily helpe to thy eternall comfort. And if any of theſe workes bee too great for vs, hee will not aske ſo much of vs, but onely in proportion to our abundance; and by no other title, but of our abundance.</p>
               <p>And it ſtandeth greatly with naturall reaſon, if we marke it. For as the waters of <hi>Nilus</hi> doe ouerflowe, and diuide themſelues once or twice a yeere vnto all the vallies, and meddowes thereabouts, to make them fruitfull out of their abundance; euen ſo it is where <hi>ſuperfluum</hi> is, and where plenty ouerflowes the bankes of our owne neede, it is made for the leuelling, and making vp of lowe places; and poore mens wants either publike or priuate, are but channels, and trenches to direct it, and leade it where it ſhould goe. And no doubt, but if God out of his Lordly power ouer vs, ſhould but vſe the miniſtery of an Angell about this ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a leuell; his iuſtice would fetch it out againe, as faſt as we hold it, that euery man and woman might haue enough, and yet the owner neuer want it.</p>
               <p>God did the like once, as we reade in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and it had beene our caſe right,
<note place="margin">Exod. 16.18</note> if <hi>Manna</hi> there had beene money, and and not meate. For he that gathered moſt of that <hi>Manna,</hi> had vſe of no more, then he that gathered leaſt; and he that gathered leaſt, had as much as he. Wherein God ſhewed vs then, in a figure, what hee would nôw haue vs to doe with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150605:113"/>our money. He ſhewed it vs then indeede by miracle. But this miracle in the old law, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would haue vs ſupply by <hi>conſcience</hi> in the new law, to make this equalitie between rich, and poore, as I touched in the beginning. The thing which he requires of vs, is this, and no more; <hi>voluntas promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ſecundum id quod habet,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.14</note> A readie will</hi> (ſaith he) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that we haue. This is the <hi>conſcience</hi> he requires of vs, and commands. And as it was with them that gathered <hi>Manna,</hi> He that had moſt, had not <hi>Superfluum,</hi> and he that had leaſt; wanted not, <hi>Qui multumhabuit non abundauit, &amp; qui modicum, non minorauit</hi> this is Saint <hi>Paules</hi> owne alluſion:
<note place="margin">ibid.</note> euen ſo it muſt be with vs. Our will is the miracle muſt do it, to make a leuell betweene the poore, and vs. Our readie will is it that muſt deuide it. Our compaſsionate heart muſt be Gods Angel heere, to diſtribute it, before it come to ruſt.</p>
               <p>For as Saint <hi>Baſill</hi> and S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſay very well;
<note place="margin">Ser. ad diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes auaros. Ser. 81. Aquin. q. 66 art. 7.</note> If they that abound, were not bound, to beſtow it againe vpon them that are needie, and poore; God were vniuſt in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of things amongſt vs, to giue ſome more then yn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, and to ſome nothing, or leſſe then ynough, when all had ynough in the beginning, and none had more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but all was common. And of this minde I verily think, there is not a couetous man in the world but would be of, if he came to taſte once what pouertie is; whereupon the learned argue thus: No man can ſay that God is vniuſt; therefore no man can ſay, that this is his owne, if it be more then ynough. Not that any man can take it from him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force; for that were villanie, and theft; but that the owners are bound to diſpence it, or diſpoſe it, where there is neede.</p>
               <p>Farre be it from God to be vniuſt. For though he giue too much one way, yet he makes it euen an other way; Like to a tender father, who leaues all he hath to the eldeſt, with charge notwithſtanding, that he be a father to the reſt, and that his brothers, and ſiſters want not: who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if they chance to want, and the eldeſt forget himſelfe; yet the father did his part, and woe be to the elder. Euen thus it fareth with euery rich man. I ſee no difference. <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:150605:114"/>giues a purſe in his hand, and a precept in his heart with it, I was naked, I was hungry, I was harbourleſſe, or friendleſſe, and in a word, I was poore, and <hi>comfortleſſe,</hi> and yee looked not at me. Theſe be his yonger brothers, that muſt not want by him. And therefore looke what wee ſwell by Gods gift, wee come downe againe by his law. How much the gift rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs, the law curbeth vs. And many a worthy body in the world, hath beene moſt glad to bee ridde of the one, that hee might bee eaſed of the other. Like honeſt receiuers, and collectours for the king; who to quit themſelues of care, and cumber, haue been content to looſe their fees, and to reſigne to others. Now what could God doe more for this <hi>equalitie</hi> but make a law? what can Princes and policie doe, but innact, and command. And if men will not obſerue, whoſe fault is it? God giues not mans Law, but conſcience-Law, the greateſt binder that is. And we reade it euery day in our poore brothers and ſiſters forehead, that we may not forget it. And therfore if we will not do it, at our perill be it.</p>
               <p>True it is, this law hath beene better knowne to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences then now it is, and yee ſhould ſeldome haue heard of coffers, and bagges full, when one was dead. And good people would haue lamented, and wept ouer them that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo, as we are wont to doe ouer them, that kill themſelues. Hence come ſo many <hi>vaes</hi> from godly people againſt rich folke, and hourders, that ſcrape, and rend, and are pittileſſe. Hence groanes, and plaints of many a <hi>pious perſon</hi> for there friends, and kinsfolke, that leaue no better comfort behind them, then ſuch a damnable ſigne. And therefore Saint <hi>James giues</hi> vs warning of it aforehand. <hi>Agite nunc diuites plorate vlulantes; Now weepe ô yee rich folke,</hi> and howle in your myſeries,
<note place="margin">Iac. 5.</note> which yee cannot auoyd. Yee heape anger againſt your ſelues in the latter day. And he telles vs the cauſe of this anger; which is keeping of <hi>Superfluum</hi> by vs. For thus hee concludes his inuectiue. <hi>The ruste of your golde,
<note place="margin">Ibid. v. 3.</note> and ſiluer ſhall bee witneſſe againſt you,</hi> ſaith hee. And how comes this ruſt, but of long lying by vs? Behold heere an other Iudgement againſt hourding. Yee hard an other euen now out of Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:150605:114"/>
               <p> A third iudgement may bee deduced out of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> where he calleth it Idolatry to be a hourder. His words are <hi>auarus, quod eſt idolorum ſeruitus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 3.5.</note> And I call this word <hi>aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in this place an hourder in engliſh, becauſe it is meant by hourders, and Scripture hath no proper word for hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but <hi>auaritia.</hi> Theft which is a kind of couetouſneſſe is called <hi>furtum.</hi> Vſurers are properly called <hi>Fenoratores;</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners are heere called <hi>Rapaces.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 7. 1. Co. 5.11.</note> Euery one of theſe hath his proper name but hourding; which is heere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called by the generall name <hi>auarus,</hi> for want of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word. And to this interpretation S. <hi>Pauls</hi> compariſon leades vs very fitly, when hee cals it Idolatry. For an Idoll is ſet vp and ſtirres not, no more does their mony. An idoll is commonly made of mettall, ſo is there mony of golde, and ſiluer. The keeping and holding of it is called heere Idolatry in reſpect of the much making of it, or hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did, that none may come at it but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. It is idolatry in regard of the honour done to it, which is due to God. For though they knowe it is not God, nor dare adore it for God; yet they loue it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as they ſhould loue God; that is to ſay, with all their heart, with al their ſoule, and leaue to God but a little.</p>
               <p>It is called idolatry alſo in the other ſence.
<note place="margin">1. Reg. 5.</note> For when God comes in place, the idoll <hi>Dagon</hi> fals to the ground. Euen ſo when grace comes, hourding breaks her neck. Then ſwelling bags begin to leake, and maſsie heapes fall in peeces. The mettal melts as the heart melts, till all be deuided into por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; goe where it ſhould goe. Some ſuch examples there be of true repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters, though very few; but many more might be, if men were not made hard like mettall, with looking at mettal; as the <hi>Liuonians</hi> were turnd to wolues, with ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing at wolues. S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes no better of theſe horders, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate perſons.
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. h.</note> For he wil not haue vs conuerſe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor ſo much as eat in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany. They be rightly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>auari quaſi eris auidi,</hi> or mony gripers; <hi>auari quaſi ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> for their bitterneſſe toward the poore; <hi>auari quaſi auerſi,</hi> they turne their backs to a body, that lookes poore, and thinne on it. And yet becauſe they wrong none in getting,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150605:115"/>they will not ſee their fault in keeping, and are in danger therefore of damning.</p>
               <p>Howbeit,
<note place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> there is none of theſe iudgements, that euer touched holy <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was <hi>diues auri, et argenti.</hi> For he kept a great houſe, and releeued many with it. Three hundred and eighteene the Scripture ſpeakes of, that were fighting men, beſides women, and children, all bredde and brought vp ſaith <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his owne houſe.
<note place="margin">lib. 1. ca. 11 1. Par. 28.</note> Theſe touched not <hi>Dauid,</hi> who heaped ſuch a maſſe of treaſure for the houſe of God, which his ſonne was to builde, and he might not. Theſe hardly touch Princes, or noble men of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences as I ſaide before; nor Magiſtrates, or Prelates, who haue great riches, if they be good men withall, and as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to poure it out againe, as faſt as it came in, to the reliefe of many. Neither touch they any other, bee they neuer ſo rich of Gods bleſsings, ſo they be humble withall, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſtore to be a burthen, will take aduiſe, and be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, where they ought, and are directed.</p>
               <p>If a man haue a yeares reuenue lying by him, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not great, and it may be fitting for him. But to haue many yeares gatherings moulding by him, I neuer yet heard or read of any good man, but one; and him it neuer did good either dead, or aliue. And that was <hi>Narſes,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to <hi>Juſtinian</hi> for the weſt. Hee is touched with no fault but hourding. For he was otherwiſe a man both humble, and valiant, and no badde man to the poore. Hee left ſo much wealth in a ceſterne vnder ground, that it could not be carried out in many dayes after it was found. But the <hi>Emperour</hi> made a good worke of it; for hee gaue it almoſt all away to the poore. And therefore I commend <hi>Beliſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> much better, who was the other Generall for the eaſt at the ſame time, and ſawe the beſtowing of his hugeriches himſelfe vpon ſuch as were of deſert, and other pious vſes, and hoſpitals for the poore. Our nation and countrey alſo hath beene, and ſtill is as much beholding to ſuch benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours as any; and their names are memorable in townes, and citties where they abide. But eſpecially thoſe I ſay, that doe what they will doe in their life time, and not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150605:115"/>at their death onely, when they can holde it no longer themſelues.</p>
               <p>This <hi>argument</hi> (my good friends) may ſeeme as to you, but vaine, who I know are little troubled with this kinde of ſinne. And yet ye haue good meanes when ye come home to riſe and raiſe good fortunes. But the due conſideration of tempting riches of the one ſide (which wee muſt dearely anſwer for if we haue them) and of pinching pouerty on the other ſide, which but few care to comfort, or affoord a good looke on; doth teach vs to pray thus,
<note place="margin">Prou. 30.</note> and it ought to be al our prayer. <q>
                     <hi>Diuitias et mendicitatemne dederis mihi, ſed tantum victui meo tribue neceſſaria.</hi> As one ſhould ſay, Lord let not me be rich, nor clog me with <hi>Superfluum;</hi> neither let me be in beggars eſtate, nor diſtract me with want, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, onely giue me neceſſaries, and I aske no more. If ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches come, I haue but an office of charge by it, and more care I muſt haue to beſtow them well, then haply they be worth. If I be poore, I cannot pray quietly for thinking of my wants. Giue me a meane therefore betweene both (Lord) that I be not tempted to deny thee (as it is ſaid) in the ſame place,</q> 
                  <hi>ne illicear ad negandum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ibid. verſ. 9.</note> And it may bee I ſhall deny thee with hourding, if I be rich; or with ſtealing, if I be poore.</p>
               <p>And thus when our Paſtours teach vs, we muſt not think they ieaſt with vs, but ſhew vs the right way we muſt walke to dye ſecurely. There calling is to know what is good for vs better then our ſelues, and what is right and equity in all things. This law of conſcience I ſay is it, that makes all euen, which neither <hi>Solon</hi> nor <hi>Lycurgus</hi> euer knew of, to imprint in mens mindes. And which if they had, or that the Spirit of God had come within the element of naturall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and <hi>Oratours</hi> would haue vrged vs to this, as well as they. And yet many of them haue pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the very ſame, in their courſe of life, iuſt as ours doe teach vs. They contemned riches, or poured them out when they had them, content with ynough and no more. Such as <hi>Crates, Anaxagoras, Zeno, Philoxenus,</hi> and all the reſt almoſt; not one of them rich, or that ſought after it.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150605:116"/>
                  <hi>Demonax</hi> would take no care for meat or drinke, but when he was hungry he went in, where he ſaw the next dore open, &amp; took a pitta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Your excellent Poets, <hi>Homer, Ennius, Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Martiall,</hi> and others, who had wits to command riches; yet were they poore men, <hi>content</hi> onely with inward <hi>content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> let outward things go. And to come neerer our word, <hi>Empedocles</hi> thought nothing more Honorable, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Superfluum.</hi> The ſame ſaid <hi>Chilon</hi> one of the ſeauen wiſe. <hi>Poſſeſſe no more then yee neede</hi> ſaid he.</p>
               <p>And of this opinion might ſeeme to bee the greateſt worthies, almoſt that euer were, if they were not ouer <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious.</hi> Such as <hi>Cimon</hi> of Athens, <hi>Phocion, Ariſtides, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus, Epaminondas, Fabritius, Menenius;</hi> who either refuſed alwaies what was giuen them, or deuided their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſpoyles amongſt there countrymen that wanted; and left not many of them ſo much as would bury them, but were buried at the common charge. And among theſe, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paminondas</hi> aforeſaid, I know not whether he were a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Souldier, or Philoſopher, but we finde him a great louer of pouerty; one that would neither borrow of any, nor take of gift, except it were for others neede. Hee thought moſt baſely of couetouſneſſe, or hourding; and ſaide ſo vile a thing as it, could neuer take ſuch roote in vs, but by ill education. <q>Hee giues vs alſo a <hi>medicine</hi> for it. The ſame (ſaith he) that is good againſt raging luſt. Let vs barre our ſelues ſometimes of lawfull pleaſure, and we ſhall auoide vnlawfull the better: euen ſo ſaid he of <hi>Couetouſneſſe.</hi> We muſt forbeare lawfull gaine ſometimes if wee will not bee tempted of that's vnlawfull. Wee muſt not bee alwaies li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening after bargaines;</q> which if we bee, he held it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible to be iuſt, and vertuous. And by this meanes hee brought <hi>Pelopidas</hi> the Duke of Thebes, a maruellous rich man, to be a great contemner of riches, and an imbracer of pouertie. Whereby he raiſed many worthy men, and relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued numbers that wanted, and made the common to flouriſh out of his <hi>ſuperfluum,</hi> although he had children of his owne.</p>
               <p>Such an other was <hi>Scipio</hi> the patterne of all militarie prudence, and honour; who had the treaſure of many
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150605:116"/>nations to diſpoſe of, yet left no more when hee dyed, then three and thirty pound weight of ſiluer, and two of golde. Yea what left <hi>Pericles</hi> behinde him, more then what his father left him, notwiſtanding his forty yeares greatnes among the Athenians? What left <hi>Cato minor?</hi> what <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi> who might haue beene the richeſt in Athens, if hee would haue taken what was offered him by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and others? But hee would not, no not ſo much as for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or family. And I haue heard the like of an Engliſh <hi>Chancellour,</hi> who out of all his offices, and ſuperfluities that had paſſed his hands, he made vp his hundred marke a yeare (which his father left him) but an hundred pound to leaue to his heire. I ſay nothing of <hi>Plato, Plutarke, Seneca,</hi> whoſe workes are extant, and breath out nothing but contempt of that, which wee ſtriue to rende ſo much one from another.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſpeake of the Tuberones in Rome; all gentlemen of a noble houſe, but decaied; yet liued moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly ſixteene couple of them together, vpon one lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle farme, with much pouerty and paines taking, and neuer ſought for more. No more did <hi>Marcus Regulus,</hi> or <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Cincinatus;</hi> the one content with poore ſeauen acres to keepe his wife and children with; the other with foure; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cared they for more; &amp; this with good husbandry they thought ſufficient. To whom I could adde a friend of mine at this day, a younger brother of the beſt gentlemen in our countrey, but of ſmall meanes. It would doe one good to ſee him vndergoe ſo merrily his great charge of wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. He was driuen to doe all things almoſt himſelfe. He was their Cater, Nurſe, Chamberlaine, Schoolemaſter, and whatſoeuer elſe was to bee done, hee did it, either within dores, or without. His onely ſtudy was, and a worthy ſtudy, to play the good husband, and keepe within compaſſe. But I returne to my matter.</p>
               <p>Againſt this doctrine, which Diuines are ſo cleare in, ye will obiect, that there is no ſuch bond as I ſpeake of, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the poore, becauſe ye are not bound to beſtow thoſe things on your ſelues; and therefore much leſſe to giue to others. Yee grant it is good to giue, but yee are not bound.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150605:117"/>I anſwer, the conſequence is falſe. For although I may be bolde with my ſelfe, yet I may not bee bolde with another. If one owe mee money, I may refuſe to take it, though I neede it. But if I owe to him, I am bound to pay. Alſo I may refuſe to eate if I will, but I may not deny my ſeruant to eate. Againe, if my ſelfe be defamed, I neede not alwaies ſtirre in it. But if I defame another, I muſt right him. And therefore that argument holdes not.</p>
               <p>Yee obiect againe, if that bee true of Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> that wee may not keepe <hi>Superfluum,</hi> then alſo we may not get it, nor receiue it: but wee may receiue it, therefore wee may keepe it. I anſwer. The caſe is like waifes, and ſtrayes, which belong to the Lord againſt all men, vntill the owner come to challenge them; and then they bee none of the Lords. Euen ſo it is with <hi>Superfluum.</hi> It is our owne, and wee may take it, keepe it, and prouide more vntill occaſion doe come to imploy it, and no longer. And yet it may bee alſo, that we are not bound to ſeeke occaſions,
<note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, who went abroade to meete ſtrangers of purpoſe, and to bidde them come in to eate and drinke with him. Or as they of <hi>Emaus</hi> did in the Goſpell,
<note place="margin">Luk. 24.</note> who compelled the traueller to goe in and eate with them. And yet God ſo bleſſed them for it, that hee made them worthy to talke with him face to face: the one with the bleſſed trinity, as ſome expound that place; the other with Chriſt glorified, as wee reade in <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 18.13. Luk. 24.</note> and in the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Luke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly yee obiect, and yee will not bee anſwered, but tell mee I ſpeake againſt my ſelfe, and againſt nature. What (ſay you) are we not neereſt our ſelues? Haue we not wife and children to prouide for, which God hath ſent, and wee muſt keepe, and leaue behinde vs ſo prouided for, as may be anſwerable to our eſtate, and honour? Is it ſinne to gather and lay vp for them, which will not bee without care; and care will not doe it, if wee bee ſo charitable, as to ſpend it as it comes in? Is it a ſinne to purchaſe, build, or amend our eſtates? Indeede I muſt confeſſe, I ſpake euen now of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering our eſtates, rather then abating; which cannot bee well done, but out of <hi>Superfluum.</hi> For to borrow much for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150605:117"/>it, will prooue diminiſhing inſtead of amending, as my ſelfe haue tryed to my coſt ere now, when I was ſo wiſe as to leaue my eſtate to others wits, and fortunes, while my ſelfe had more minde to higher ſtudies. But to ſatisfie you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this point, I ſhould referre you ouer to your learned maſters,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> who are <hi>parati ad ſatisfactionem omni petenti ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> It belongs to vs to beleeue, and not to diſpute. I am no Diuine, but onely an inſtructed Chriſtian, as you and all may be, that will aske, and learne.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, if yee will take ſuch ſatisfaction as is to mee ſatisfaction; it may pleaſe you to accept it, vntill a better come. There bee many iuſt occaſions of ſpending our <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluum</hi> beſides the poore. I will giue inſtance onely of a houſe; which a man may want, and were no more then fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for his eſtate, but hee hath it not. They hold it a ſinne to weaken his meanes, and ſell much land for it, as it were to make a rich coate for one that lyes a dying, or is ſicke of a conſumption. If his <hi>Superfluum</hi> will doe it, he may doe his minde in it. Many poore ſhall haue worke, and reliefe by it, and if hee keepe a good houſe after for the poore, and not a ſhew of a houſe, for the world to gaze on, as ſome haue done; his conſcience will bee the better ſatisfied, and the world in him, that God is not forgotten, but hath his part in it.</p>
               <p>There is no queſtion made, but a man may purchaſe what hee will out of <hi>Superfluum,</hi> ſo the lawes of loue bee kept to his neighbour, which I ſpake of before. Hee muſt not gripe him by no meanes, nor worke vpon his neede, but giue him the full worth. A gentleman ſtands in more neede ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times then a poorer man in ſhew. And it may bee a deede of charity to buy of him, if lending will not ſerue. And wee ſhall neuer be charged with it for hourding. But I muſt tell you more what they hold, and it is a caueat to all <hi>purchaſers.</hi> They muſt not put themſelues vpon the <hi>taint</hi> ſo, as to ſhut vp doores, or abate ſaile for it a yeare or two after; but the more they purchaſe, the more they muſt ſpend, either in their houſe, vpon increaſe of an honeſt retinue, or vpon the poore elſewhere; fiue perſons more for euery hundred
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150605:118"/>pound land purchaſed, were not much. If <hi>Craſſus</hi> had gotten it as well, as hee ſpent it well what hee got, hee had beene a right good man. Hee kept a Legion ſome whiles together at his owne charge, beſides other good workes of his. How much more ſhould Chriſtians doe the like. They may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe warily; but they muſt ſpend it liberally. They may heape, but not hourd; like, but not loue too much. And the greater meanes one hath, the more in ſtore for them that want.</p>
               <p>They bee miſers that purchaſe, and ſpend no more; lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to the common; they abuſe the law of <hi>Superfluum,</hi> and the bleſſings of God beſtowed on them. Yet how many bee there of theſe that wee could reckon; who liue at the ſame rate now, as they did many years ſince, when they could not ſpend the tenth nor twentieth part. They keepe neuer the more ſeruants, ſet neuer the more on worke, feede no more mouthes, giue no more to the poore, or contribute to the common much more then they did. And what a world ſhould we haue, if there were many rich, and euery rich man ſhould doe ſo. Either men muſt periſh, or ſeeke ſome where elſe where to dwell. Wee may iudge of a whole countrey by a little countrey towne, of fortie, or fifty houſes, with land to them all, and one man buyes them out, and diſpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the village. What becomes of the poore the whileſt, who liued there wholly vpon reliefe, haply ten, or a dozen? No doubt hee is bound to keepe them, out of his increaſe. They muſt bee part of his purchaſe, or appurtenances; yet will not ſpend two pence the more for it, but poſtes them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to the ſhire, if he can, to begge their bread. Would not many ſuch townes in a countrey conſume a countrey? and is it not happy that prouiſion was made for it betimes in later Parliaments?

               <p> I aſſeſſed therefore euery hundred pound a yeares in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe at keeping fiue poore bodies, or ſetting them on worke, beſides his houſhold. Whether I exceede or come ſhort in this reckoning, I muſt refer it to your iudgements, and experience. Our doctours intermeddle not ſo farre, but leaue it to mens conſciences, ſo they make a true conſcience of it. But if ye thinke that I grate too much vpon you;

                  <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentote dierum antiquorum,</hi> call to mind the ancient daies, when there were not ſuch ſtore of poore, as now therebe to beſtow their <hi>ſuperfluum</hi> on. But in lieu thereof, what a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Churches, &amp; Chappels were then built, euery three miles walke doth teſtifie; beſides Biſhopricks, and houſes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, free-ſchooles, hoſpitals, bridges, almeſ-houſes, &amp; other works of charity euery where to be ſeen, with lands to moſt of them all. Which if it be well pondered, and how largely they powred out their <hi>ſuperfluum</hi> in thoſe daies; the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I ſpeake of, will not ſeeme great to make vp this equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. It is hard to make a rule in this buſines, if conſcience do it not. But very probable it is, if a man ſpend halfe his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in houſ-keeping, &amp; among the poore, and leaue nothing of it at the yeares ende, hee will haue little to anſwer for in that; and the remainder will not be much. But not to ſpend halfe that way, not a quarter, not a fift, or a tenth part, as many doe not; thât they hold to be execrable in the ſight of God, and intolerable in a common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Neither is their any ſence or husbandry in it, to hord &amp; lay vp for children, which made ſuch a flouriſh in the contrary argument at the firſt. There is no ſence I ſay, for the portion will not grow bigger with locking vp. Not good husbandry, when Scripture it ſelfe aduiſeth vs to put it out to bankers or other lawfull gaine, and not to hide it or dig it into the ground;
<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Opportuit te committere pecuniam meam nummularijs.</hi> And ſo no doubt it would bee both ſurer to them that ſhall haue it; and alſo more auaileable to them, then if it lay cankering all the while in a corner to look one.</p>
               <p>But the thing I ſhould haue ſpoken of at the firſt, I may not omitte to ſpeake of laſt. And that is, how to know <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluum,</hi> and when we haue it. For the true deciding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150605:119"/>I thinke wee ſhall neede a iudge. For if men bee their owne iudges, they thinke they haue neuer enough, much leſſe too much. Witneſſe their owne complaints, if we talke with them ſeriouſly about this buſineſſe, though they bee neuer ſo rich. And I thinke they ſay truely in reſpect of their want of that they intend, and would compaſſe; but falſely, in reſpect of our duty to God, and bond to the poore. <hi>Couetouſneſſe</hi> is a moſt vile paſsion, and couetous perſons are neuer out of it. The angry body is not alwaies angry. The ſpitefull body not alwayes enuious. The vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and gluttonous bodies are not alwayes ſo. Theſe haue a time to ſee their faults, beeing as it were in a tertian, or quartan, the other allowes no intermiſsion, but is in a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian till he dye. And being alwayes therefore in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he cannot iudge rightly of himſelfe. Hee knowes not his owne way, or worke ſo well as an other, or as himſelfe either, if his fitte would giue leaue. Which yet, becauſe it will not, he can hardly iudge right, but partially without a good friend to helpe him.</p>
               <p>And this is <hi>Plutarkes</hi> rule, not mine. That when wee are doubtfull, whether wee doe well or ill, and whether we mend or impaire,
<note place="margin">Deira cohib.</note> and we cannot goe out of our ſelues as Paynters doe from their worke a while, to iudge the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a fault when they come to it againe: heere (ſaith he) wee had need conuent our ſelues before ſome friends, or friend, and aske their opinions what is amiſſe, and would be amended in vs. A golden rule, and more worthy a Chriſtian, then a heathen. And if we follow it, we could neuer erre. Neither can any man want ſuch a friend, if he be humble, or as curious for his ſoules health, as he is for ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer things. But what is he that knowes not his owne ſtore, and expences; or how few there be, that fare the better by him? Let him thinke with himſelfe whether he would not ſpend leſſe if he could with honeſty. Let him call to mind, how many mens lands, and inheritances he holds, whereof euery one fedde many, and hee feedes not one the more? Can hee ſee this, and know this, and thinke hee hath nor <hi>Superfluum?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:150605:119"/>
               <p> Or if he neuer were purchaſer; yet hee cannot but know how much comes in to him, more then he ſpendes, welfare all good tokens. His bagges make mention, if hee haue eyes to ſee them. Hee is well ynough ſighted, to iudge of his neighbours, what euery one is worth. And can he not ſee himſelfe much better? He will ſay, ſuch a one is but a poore man, or not the man he is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for. Such a one is well to liue, and before hand. Such a one is a neere man, and hath thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, or a thouſand to ſpare; and yet doth not know, what himſelfe hath to ſpare? His coſt vpon iron cheſts, and double dores, and lockes moſt curious; doe not all theſe point him to his <hi>Superfluum?</hi> his feare of robbing, his heart now and then miſgiuing, or his minde ſtill running on it, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall audit in his braine; doe not all theſe vſher him dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the mint of his treaſure; and can hee not yet ſee, or thinke, that he hath <hi>Superfluum?</hi> There is none ſo blind, but may ſee it if he will, though many bee ſo ſelfe-louing, that they liſt not to heede it.</p>
               <p>And of this, my comming is to heede you, and to aduiſe you my deere louers, and friends, that when yee come to haue more ſtore of Gods bleſsings, ye may make a bleſsing of it, and not abuſe your ſelues, abuſe God, abuſe his holy word, as all that be couetous doe; who haue nothing ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in their heart, and ſoule, and it is all the Scripture they practiſe, <hi>Noli eſſe iustus multum,</hi> Be not ouer iuſt, and, <hi>Omnia traham ad me ipſum,</hi> I will draw all to my ſelfe,
<note place="margin">Eccleſiaſtes 7.17. Ioh. 12.</note> and my fellowes ſhall haue none. As who ſhould ſay all were borne beggars to make him great; all mens fortunes ordained to raiſe his fortunes. And it is not out of time, that I aduiſe you thus. It may be no time fitter then euen now, that the world goes diminiſhing euery day from God, and all goodneſſe; and ſtands a great deale more vpon will and pride, then it hath done eſchewing counſell. As euery man thinkes it aduantageable for him, ſo goes right and wrong with him, and hee will bee his owne iudge. Time hath beene, that theſe cloaked, and coloured ſinnes haue not beene ſo common, as now they are. Either people haue beene more ſingle-hearted, or eaſier to be inſtructed then
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150605:120"/>they be now; and had more care of the world to come, and how to gette thither, then to ſit deuiſing with themſelues how to make themſelues great here, and let heauenly things come after at leiſure. But let vs leaue the reaſon to God. Once we finde his word to be true, <hi>Diminutae ſunt veritates a filijs hominum,</hi> Truthes are clipt and diminiſh't from the ſons of men;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 11.</note> and the ſons of God (if we bee ſo) muſt reſtore them againe. If we will aske, we may finde. And wee haue the ſame oracles we had, the ſame ſpirit to teach vs, and to ſet on foot again that primitiue iuſtice, if we wil imbrace it.</p>
               <p>Couetouſneſſe is a moſt venemous thing, contagious, and vnneighbourly, fedde onely with ſelfe-loue, a moſt baſe and vnworthy loue, and I haue giuen you rules againſt it. <hi>Prodigality</hi> alſo, and <hi>Riot,</hi> are naught; and I haue told you, what a ſinne it is to waſte ones eſtate wilfully, and how ye may auoide it with frugality. Both ſorts are very ſinnefull. For the couetous body perſwades himſelfe, that all the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluum</hi> hee hath, is no more but needefull. The prodigall makes no more of his needfull, then if it were <hi>ſuperfluum,</hi> and ſo poures it out waſtfully without wit. The ſweet mean is betweene both, which there is no difficulty to practiſe with the helpe of God, and your cheerefull indeauour.</p>
               <p>To which end, I haue told you many things which a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous eare would be loath to heare at the firſt, vntill he do deepely conſider what will become of things at laſt. And yet if I haue any thing ſaid, more then your learned wil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue; let it be as vnſaid. I haue laid before you but their concluſions; which if ye ſhall doubt of, your pious ſcrupulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie for better reſolution, knowes whether to repaire. Out of my loue I would haue you iuſtly informed, and as it were catechiſed in matters of iuſtice, as ye are wont to be in your points of faith. For which cauſe, I haue ſpent ſome time with you; but I deſire no more credite, then what your learned will affirme. I told you there muſt be equality whereſoeuer there is good gouernment; euen betweene king and ſubiect reſpectiuely, and betweene rich and poore. Yea, there can be no ſtable gouernment, where this is not well lookt into, as it hath beene in the beginning of all common-wealths.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:150605:120"/>
               <p> To ſome belongs more, to ſome leſſe, euery one muſt haue neceſſaries to their eſtat; which if they haue not, they ought to be ſupplied. And the ſupply makes as iuſt an equality, as if al had alike. If one haue mony, and another haue wares, they are equall. If one be poore, and another ſupply, they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall. If one haue ſubſtance, and another deſire it not, they are equall:
<note place="margin">Epiſt. 120.</note> it is all one to haue (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) and not to deſire to haue. For equality conſiſteth not in hauing alike, but not wanting alike. If wants bee ſupplyed, all is equall; if not ſupplyed, there is a fault, that muſt bee amended. Yea; where knowne want is, and no ſupply; ſome mans pinching will ſmart for it in the world to come; and none haue cauſe to feare it ſo much, as they that haue <hi>Superfluum.</hi> No law to pull it from them, but the law of conſcience as I ſaid, which to obſerue is to make all euen; and nôt to obſerue, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke Gods diſpleaſure, who is Lord of all; and no more is to bee done in it, then heathens can in the buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore I haue gone with you by degrees, to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your conſciences; as how yee ſhould loue your ſelfe, and how your neighbour. Your ſoule firſt, his next. Your owne life firſt, his next; vnleſſe hee be a publike perſon, or very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the common-weale. Your goods, and fortunes likewiſe, how to bee vſed frugally, yet charitably, without hurting your ſelues, or your ſoules. I might haue ſaid how bountifull alſo for gifts, and benefits to followers, and fauourites, according to their deſerts, and your abilities; elſe it will ſoone be ſinne, and ſinke mens eſtates with ouermuch good nature, ere they bee aware. And this is more to bee pittied, then any thing; beſides the offence to God-ward. Likewiſe how yee may purchaſe, and what conditions for buying and ſelling without wrong, or exaction.

               <p>I haue not omitted to ſay ſomewhat of our duty to the common, and of the greatnes of this bond, and of the cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and alacrity wee ought to entertaine it with, ſorry that our hand is not in euery publike worke, though no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaw it, but onely God. To the king eſpecially; who as hee is great by law, ſo ſhould hee be greater in our loue, and haue part with vs in all, but in grudge and contradiction. So farre bee it from vs to magnifie him in words, and minnifie him in workes, as they doe to <hi>Conquerers</hi> and <hi>Tyrants.</hi> And laſtly I come to your <hi>Superfluum,</hi> whereof I haue ſhewne you ſome deformities, and what a monſter it would prooue in a common-wealth, if lawes did not reprooue it ſomewhat, and conſcience more. And yet I haue beene briefe vpon the point; the matter requiring more perſwaſion, then inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more eloquence, then arguments, and more grace in the hearer, then tongue in the teacher. For why?</p>
               <p>Goods if they bee good, they haue wrong to be kept in. <hi>Omne bonum eſt ſui communicabile,</hi> The nature of good is to doe good, and to impart it ſelfe to others, if man doe not hinder it. The ſprouting ſprings are not content with their owne fulneſſe, and to ſerue the neighbourhood with pailes full and tankardsfull, but ſend the reſt immediately to poore Millars, and Fiſhermen, and make riuers nauigable for the vſe of man. The liuer not content to feede it ſelfe with blood, packes away the ouerplus all the body ouer, euen to fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and toes, as farre as it can goe. Yea, golde and ſiluer not ſatisfied with their owne riches, and brightneſſe; nor pretious gemmes with their luſter, and vertue, where they lye in ſea coaſtes, or deſart mountaines; but offer themſelues
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150605:121"/>to mans induſtry, whoſoeuer will fetch them.

It is againſt nature to keepe good things in. Yet wee, by corrupt vſage ſmother vp all in corners, that none may bee better for them. If one may doe it, all may doe it. And what if all ſhould doe the like? what if all were hourders? ſhould wee not thinke them <hi>Caterpillers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Say it were not money wee hourded, but that wee bought vp all the beefes and muttons in markets, all the corne, and graine that comes there; and all other commodities that come in for mans prouiſion: would not townes and countries cry out on vs? and is it not all one, to hourd vp e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans prouiſion, and to hourd vp that which men ſhould buy it with? If all ſhould hourd vp corne as one did, a countri-man of ours, who ſolde no corne but in deare yeares; ſhould they not bee murtherers to the multitude, and quellers to their owneſoules? The man was rich, and had alwaies three yeares corne in barnes, and ſtackes before hand. His farme was his owne, rich ground all of it. The fourth yeare, vpon a Whitſune-eue, he walked vp a hill, and ſaw the countrey full of goodly corne, and came home to the good woman his wife, and tolde her he was vndone. <q>Why ſo ſaid ſhee. It is likely to be a plentifull yeare againe ſaid hee.</q> Marry thankes bee to God ſaid ſhee, many ſuch yeares God ſend vs. But hee went into his barne, and hung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſo had dyed if chance had not beene. The hourder doth ynough for his part, that no man ſhould haue either money, or wares. <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> taught a citizen how to imploy his money better then ſo. For hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of much treaſure hee had hidden in the ground, he ſent vnto him to bring it him; which hee did. But hee brought not out all. And that which hee left, hee beſtowed preſently vpon houſe and land in the countrey. Which when the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant alſo heard of, hee ſent for him, and gaue him his money againe, ſaying to him: <q>ſince thou knoweſt how to vſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, take thy money againe, which is made to vſe, and not to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150605:122"/>lye by one;</q> and ſo diſmiſſed him. Glad was he that he learnt ſo good cheape. But woe be to the country that knowes not how to vſe riches, vntill a Tyrant teach it them.</p>
               <p>True riches is to haue ſtore of neceſſaries, wherewith to feede many, not ſtore of <hi>Superfluum,</hi> that no body may touch. Golde and ſiluer will not feede as they lye, nor coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniture with gazing on.

But when hee came to <hi>Menelaus</hi> his houſe, where was plenty of ſuperfluous things: the romes bright with copper, gold, and alchumy; and pillars of great magnificence: he was ready to adore, ſaying:

               <p>NOw let me not holde you ouer long. As I profeſſed in the beginning, to ſay nothing of open ſinnes, but of theſe cloſe, and cloaked ſinnes, which are ſinnes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, and full of iniuſtice: ſo haue I ſaid no more then nature teacheth vs, as well as law diuine; what a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Cupiditie</hi> is, and how groſſely it miſleades vs, and how contrary to it owne ſelfe, more then other Cupidities
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150605:122"/>are. I beganne with <hi>Plutarke</hi> a heathen wiſe man,
<note place="margin">In his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls.</note> and I will ende with him. Hee tels vs plainely that no Cupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo fighteth with it ſelfe as this of riches doth. <q>All other deſires, are more for vſing then poſſeſsing. This contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry more for poſſeſſing, then vſing. Wee deſire not meate, to abſteine from it, we deſire not wine to forbeare it, wee deſire not warme cloathes to lay them vp: but when wee haue eaten wee are ſatisfied, when wee haue drunke wee haue enough, when our gowne is on, it is cumber to put on more;</q> and if wee haue our pleaſure at any time, we haue done with it ſoone. Onely riches when wee haue them, our thirſt is not alaide; wee ſtill deſire more. The more we haue the more we couet, <hi>Semper auarus eget;</hi> new rents, and new commings in aſſwage not our appetite while wee liue; but the medicine increaſes the diſeaſe. To this wee may adde. What hinders vs more in our iourney to heauen, then this vntoward Cupidity? what ſtoppes vs to doe iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with our neighbour, friend, or brother, but Cupidity? what makes vs grate vpon him, and draw what we can from him, but this? what blindes vs ſo that we ſee not our debt to the poore, but this? for ſo the Scripture cals it <hi>debitum,</hi>

Who can abide to heare this? ye will ſay they be lewde folke now a daies, and vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and it is no charity to giue them. How then? I talke not of giuing them, I ſpeake of debt. It is our abundance as I ſaid before, and not their goodneſſe, that makes it theirs. If they be badde, they muſt liue to amend,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> God ſends raine vpon the iuſt, and vniuſt; and our debts we muſt pay both to good, and badde; whereof this debt is one to the poore, howſoeuer cupidity blindes vs, and caſts a vaile ouer our eies, that we cannot ſee it. Poets faine <hi>Cupid</hi> blinde: euen ſo is Cupidity. It couereth our vnderſtanding, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth reaſon awry, it ſtrengtheneth paſsion weakeneth iudgement, rayſeth pride puts downe pitty, fireth enuy cooleth charity, preacheth parſimony hateth hoſpitality, is open handed to take cloſe fiſted to giue, no, not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; robbes the king of that is his, the ſubiect of his, the

We may call it in a ſort a ſinne againſt nature, that beareth ſuch a ſting againſt it ſelfe, and owne honour. O thinke not leſſe of it becauſe it is leſſe ſeene. The more hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a ſinne is, the more dangerous. I haue diſcouered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you many a ſinnefull practiſe to day, which it may bee yee haue not heard of.

It is no rare thing amongſt ſinners, not to ſee their fault, vntill they be told of it. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> complaineth of himſelfe, that he hath ſet vp a vice for a vertue ſometimes. Now what thinke yee I pray you of all theſe, and what of your ſelues? are ye ſtronger and better ſighted then they? might yee not bee deceiued all this while in your courſes, as well as they? and if we haue a plague or plagues in our country, may it not be for ſome of theſe hidden ſinnes, though there were no other? And

How much better is it therefore for vs to take warning by theſe, and to furniſh our ſelues in time with ſufficient knowledge, eſpecially where ignorance will no way excuſe. <hi>Omnis via virirecta ſibi.</hi> The Spirit of God foretels vs as it now prooues, that euery one thinkes hee is in the right, when he is not, nor is like to bee,

                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> ſaith he. And King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> tels vs in another place, where he ſpeakes to God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 98.</note> 
                  <hi>Tu paraſti directiones;</hi> That God prouided directions for euery one that will aske. Yea more then this, if wee aske not, it is a ſigne (I thinke) that God is angry with vs. For ſo he ſpeakes of a ſinner, that <hi>Secundum multitudinem irae ſuae non quaeret,</hi> It is according to the greatneſſe of Gods anger,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 9.25.</note> that a ſinner will not ſeeke, or aske. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why doe men aske no oftner then they doe, or follow them no better? or why doe they not weare downe their threſholds with comming, and going, as they are bidden? And I ſpeake not this to hourders onely, but to young men, and ſpenders alſo; who daily vndoe themſelues for want of directions. I neuer knew any man waſte himſelfe, that was ruled by ſuch. And of all the vnthrifts that euer I heard of, I neuer knew any, that was ruled by ſuch. They will be ruled by cheaters, &amp; thoſe that prey vpon them, but not by ſuch. They will liſten to them that humor them, but not to them that pitty them, and wiſh them all true wealth. Both ſorts neede counſell, I know not which more. Whether he that will waſte all with ouer laſhing; or hee that ruines many with ouer-keeping. You ſtand yet indifferent betweene both. But which way ſoeuer you incline; bee neuer your owne iudges, but liſten. Bee fearefull alwayes to endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage any man, and at ſuch times eſpecially I wiſh you to be aduiſed moſt, when yee haue moſt aduantage, or are likely to gaine moſt. There be that perſwade you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world; I entreate you onely that it contemne not you, when it hath tumbled you into the lake. To them
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150605:124"/>it belongs, to ſhew you the fickleneſſe, and deceit of it; I doe but wiſhe you to imprint it in your minde. Your prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers tell you, how and what yee muſt hourd;
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>theſauriza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te vobis theſauros in coelis,</hi> Heape treaſure in heauen; I doe but admoniſh you of your ſinne againſt nature, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of your good meanes, which God hath lent you. Thêy tell you how hardly things are gotten, how ſoone loſt, and how little they deſerue of vs, for all our much making, and will not ſo much as accompany vs to our graue: I ſay no more then what <hi>Leonidas</hi> tolde you, when <hi>Xerxes</hi> wrote vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to come on his ſide, and hee would make him much greater then euer hee was. But hee wrote vnto him againe. <q>If thou knewſt ô <hi>Xerxes</hi> what the goods of this life are, and how little to bee eſteemed,</q> thou wouldeſt not ſeeke as thou doeſt for others mens. This yee will thinke was well ſaide of a king, a ſouldier, a heathen. Wee ſhould know better then hee, what theſe things are. What bee they better the beſt of them, then a penny in a paile of water, ſeeme great, and are not; fire in ones boſome, burne more then warme; a wagge, or wanton much cockered and loued, and loues not againe? when wee dye, they are as readily another mans as ours, who tooke all the care to get them together. Let vs learne of a heathen for very ſhame, if not for charity, nor loue of Chriſt, to eſteeme as little of theſe outward things, as they doe of vs. That is to ſay, to make vſe of them, and no more; or at the leaſt, not to prize them ſo, as to lye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering by vs long. If yee like to goe light, and free from burthen, heape not burthen vpon burthen; which if ye doe, yee will hardly keepe euen, but one ſinne or other will ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take you, and giue you a fall. <hi>Qui pauca requirunt, non mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis exidunt,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> They that ſeeke little, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend little; therefore they that ſeeke much, offend much; and what they get ill, will prooue ill, doe what they can. What will it auaile a man to circumuent his poore brother, and to get by him (as they ſay) by right or wrong? I haue tolde you, it is wrong, if hee get it ſo; and it muſt bee repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ere yee dye. If learned men bee learned, and haue not beſtowed all their time in vaine; if God haue promiſed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150605:125"/>them his ſpirit to direct you; if they bee not very cyphers, and dumbe ſhewes onely;
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> and furthermore, if God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them our ſoules in charge, for their knowledge and grace; and wee as much bound to heare them, as the Iewes were to heare theirs in the olde law;
<note place="margin">Oſe 4. Ier. 17.</note> who helde it the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinne that was, to diſobey them in any thing: and laſtly, if wee bee not very <hi>Atheists,</hi> and enemies to all religion; thêy bee the men wee ought to beleeue in the caſes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, where wrong, or iniuſtice may in any ſort bee doubted. The very attempt and throught of wrong, is wrongfull, much more the accompliſhing. And beleeue mee they will none of them prooue as they promiſe, but deceiue vs moſt pittifully in the end. I haue known &amp; ſeen it in many. If God loue them, hee will neuer let them thriue with it long; but either they ſhall looſe it quite, that they get ſo, or ſhall haue more vnquietneſſe, and trouble with it, then it is worth. If God loue vs not; wee may thriue with it iollily for a time, and ſome of our poſterity after vs for our greater plague. God giues the wicked alſo their deſires, but it is in anger, not in mercie ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtine.</hi> And then, what are wee better for Sunne-ſhine, if hee that made the Sunne frowne on vs. Wee ſauour not now adaies of the ancient piety, and Chriſtian feeling that hath beene. Men and women haue thought it burthenſome to their conſciences, to keepe any thing wrongfully. It lay heauily on their ſtomacks like raw fleſh, when they had done amiſſe. And if they were of any reſolution to God-ward, they would not touch, nor come neere that was none of their owne. Whereof wee haue a noble example of <hi>Constantine,</hi> who forbad the tribute of <hi>Curtizans</hi> to defile his coffers, as they were wont. And our Chriſtian <hi>Tiberius</hi> whom I named before, would none of <hi>Narſes</hi> his maſſie treaſure. Hee knew not how it was got, that was ſo euilly kept. And the ſame Prince before he came to bee Emperour, beeing made Maſter of the Pallace, and declared ſucceſſor to <hi>Iustinus;</hi> whoſe wife <hi>Sophia</hi> that coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Empreſſe had gotten together ilfauouredly great heaps of treaſure: this worthy man when hee found it, hee pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it all out, and ſent it packing to the poore. Whereat
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:150605:125"/>when the olde Empreſſe was angry, and asked him what he meant to bee ſo lauiſh of that ſhee got together with ſuch labour, and anxious care for her husband; ô ſaid hee, <q>the Exchecker I hope ſhall neuer neede ſuch ill gotten goods.</q> And his words prooued true. For there was neuer Prince ſo rich and fortunate in all things, that euer I read of, as hee was afterward for the time hee raigned, which was ſeauen yeares. And who more infortunate then <hi>Brennus</hi> the french Duke after hee had ſpoyled Temples, and robbed Churches of their treaſure, ſaying; the gods had neede giue vs, and not wee giue them. And was there any in the world, more vnhappy then <hi>Caepio Seruilius,</hi> and his partners, after the ſpoyle of the Temple of <hi>Tholouſa,</hi> where they had infinite treaſure, ynough to haue made them all for euer? but as <hi>Liuie</hi> noteth, none of them all proſpered, but miſerably dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Caepio</hi> himſelfe, was ouerthrowne by the <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> was turned out of his Conſulſhip, as neuer was any before him; his goods confiſcate, was tumbled headlong downe the ſtaires, and dyed in yrons, hauing beene happy enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and triumphed ouer the <hi>Cilicians.</hi> But this is the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him that ſearcheth all things, and winkes at them ſtill that doe naughtily, vntill hee ſees his time, to come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them with vengeance. And what hath a man gotten when hee hath rent and ſcrap't together what hee can? ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a cappe and knee it may bee, for his fortune; for it was but his fortune. Many a ſecret curſe that hee dies not yet; for they haue no hope of him to doe much good, while hee liueth: many a nodde hee gets beſides at his manner of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. For ſuch a one is vndone by him ſaith one, and yet he was no intereſt man. Hee hath much to anſwer for ſaith another, and yet hee neuer tooke forfeiture, or ſolde to daies. Hee hath beene hard to the common ſaith one; yet hee would hoyſe vp his fellowes ſaies another. The king is the worſe for ſuch as hee, ſaith one; but it is more then the king knowes, ſaith another. Thus they play vpon the poore penny-father. But hee ſhall not want ſome alſo, that will praiſe him, and commend him, to bee a very kinde man to his friend; ſo it coſt him nothing, ſaith another. One com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150605:126"/>him for a good <hi>Iuſticer;</hi> hee will not come in danger of lawe, ſaith another. I haue ſeene him giue well to the poore, ſaith one; ſo it bee well ſeene, ſaith another. Hee is very wiſe ſaith one; <hi>to haue and holde,</hi> ſaith another. Hee was continent of his body, ſaith one; hee ſaued by that, ſaith another. So euery vertue of his hath a ſpunge with it, and euery vice a penſill. Fewe thinke well of him heartily, no not they that faine would. And when hee comes to dye, what laughing teares follow, and blackes of ioy, not of mourning. And heere begins his wofull pageant. If all his golde were in his carkaſſe, hee would haue as many houndes about him, as a dead horſe, or as there bee tormenters about his beggarly ſoule. His conſcience torments him, and wounds him, that euer hee was ſo carking for that he ſhould neuer haue with him. His memory tortures him, to thinke of his cares, and what a ſlaue hee was to them, and is not the better of a pinne for them now, but the worſe. His feare affrights him, that they that haue all, will bee deceiued with it, as hee was. Hee feares his wife will come to him ſhortly, or his childe, or ſome body elſe whom hee loued; and this torments him extreamely. The diuels floute him inſtead of comforting him; and thoſe whom hee wronged, haue neuer done accuſing him to his thinking. His wits confound him, and rende his heart in peeces with cruell diſtractions. His throate hoarſe with crying, skrieking, and helliſh groanes. Hee would faine get out by him that came in laſt, but impoſſible. All his fellowes ſo grifly and gaſhfull, that it is a hell alone to ſee them. If a man were amongſt Turks, or Cannibals, hee might haply finde ſome face of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tler aſpect, then other, to eaſe his heart, and make his moane vnto; there not ſo, all inſociable villaines. No friende, or olde acquaintance there to befriende him. No not brother, or ſiſter, but to take him by the throate, and ſpit fire in his face. It bootes him not to lye ſtill, he is ſo full of paine. It helpes him not to ſtirre, for being made to lye ſtill. No kinde of hope hath acceſſe, but is bar'd, and double bar'd from him. It were ſome comfort vnto him, if he could not thinke at all. All thoughts are laſhes to him
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150605:126"/>with an iron whippe. See how the poore wretch is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To thinke of golde, is to thinke of a toad. To thinke of them that haue it, and care little for him, it wrings him to the guttes. To remember the pleaſures he had in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer his grounds, makes him as melancholy as a mad man. To thinke of heauen loſt for a trifle, ſo like an Aſſe as he was, he knawes his fleſh from his bones. Alaſſe, how ſhort I come of his dreadfull eſtate with my ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der imagination? But ſurely when ſuch a ſoule reflects vpon ſuch a miſery, hee frettes and grieues, and wrings his hands ſo pittiouſly, that a heart of braſſe would melt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde it. But all in vaine. Hee would faine imagine it a dreame, but that is idle. He wiſhes hee were in ſome dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon full of ordure, in a ſtinking priſon full of irons, in a ſhipwracke at ſea, in the bottome of a deepe well, or in an ouen full of flames; yet all this in vaine. Wiſhes doe no more but torment more. He curſes God to his face, he cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his parents, and progenitors; he curſes all flatterers, and them that ſoothed him vp; hee curſes himſelfe moſt damnably, that had but one ſinne, or euill diſpoſition to take heede of, and ſet ſo light by it. He findes it now, that he ſaw and would not ſee, knew and would not know, hee might haue askt, and would not ſtoupe for it, becauſe he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his owne waies. Poore wretch, forlorne, miſerable, and forſaken wretch. If he were in life againe, what would he doe? hee could tell how to vſe the matter, better then hee did. Which I pray God, we may learne to doe by his wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full example, if we ſaw him. It is not land, or mony, or goodly things, or faire glozes, that would damne him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if he were aliue againe. He was not ſo griping, as he would now be giuing. He was not ſo vpon aduantage, as he would now giue aduantage. He was not ſo ready to rend fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man the one halfe, as now to render fourefold; not ſo ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring then towards common good, as now more for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his priuat; not ſo proud then of his fortunes, as now humble &amp; affable; not ſo large then, as now ſcrupulous; not ſo auerted then from the poore, as now compaſsionate and tender ouer the poore, and rather delighting in them.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:150605:127"/>This day let all men aſſure themſelues, will one day come, and will not bee long, but they ſhall ſee how fooliſh they were for all their ſeeming wit; how little for all their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; how poore, and ragged for all their hourding, &amp; ſcrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together; how full of lip-labour all their praiers, &amp; how courſe their conceits in heauenly affaires. More ſhall they ſee vnder a ſilly winding ſheete, then vnder a Cannopy of gold; more in the dumpes of their euerlaſting melancholy, then heere in the height of their iolitie. But all to late af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter finall impenitence. O that any teares of ours, or ſobs of endleſſe lamentation might giue them eaſe, but they will not. I ſpeake no more of them; my heart doth bleede, that any of theſe woes ſhould fall vpon any one. But it hath beene, and will be. Yet thankes be to God, and truely let vs reioyce, and clappe our hands, all we that are yet liuing, and are not as yet in that dolefull pitte. There is no wrong but we may yet right. And it may be, there is yet no wrong but we may preuent. Let vs be wiſe betimes, and learne by other mens harmes. Wee eſpecially that profeſſe our ſelues of Gods houſhold; and let vs accuſtome our ſelues to bee ſcrupulous, and to doe nothing without counſell. It will trouble vs much to reſtore againe, when we haue wronged. Wee finde by experience they will bee damned firſt (as wiſe as they are) before they will heare of it. To thinke all ours, that we force from a body by law, or might, it is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. To doe otherwiſe then we will bee done to, is little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or honeſty. To ſooth our ſelues with ill cuſtome, where nothing warrants, but ill cuſtome, is to cozen our ſelues, and make ſport for the deuill. Now let vs caſt vp our eyes to heauen, if we be not caſt-awaies, and deſperate. Let not a little mony damne vs, or hope of gaine gaine-ſay vs, when we knocke at heauen gate. Nay why ſhould wee hazzard our beſt part ſo, or put our heauenly portion in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture for it. What reaſon haue wee to looſe a certen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there, for an vncertenty heere? Why ſhould we looſe a thouſand poundesſure our owne, for an hundred halfpence not ſure our owne, or how long we ſhall haue it? away with it. Let it not taint our cheſts, and canker our ſoules. Put
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:150605:127"/>it not together with that is well gotten. In ſtead of giuing, or lending where neede is, let vs not take another mans without need, and which no neede ſhould compell vs vnto. He that hath leaſt, hath enough of that little to anſwer for, though he heape not on himſelfe more, by wreſting from others. If yee will be patient, and milde, and void of all paſsion; if ye will free your ſelues from enuy, and anger, which I told you in the beginning is ſo neceſſary for vs; and laſtly, if ye will goe light to heauen when ye dye, and will be alwayes ready for it when God ſhall call; away with your clogge of cupidity: let it approach your heart no more; but be indifferent to all things, whether ye haue them or no, and aſſure your ſelues ye ſhall gaine in the end by it. <hi>Magnus questus pietas, cum ſufficientia,</hi> Better a little with content,

This is it, that makes it hard, or impoſsible. It is our ſelues that make it hard. Heauen is hard enough of it ſelfe to come by, yet wee forſooth muſt make it harder. Our vnfortunate coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hath giuen vs ſuch a law, that it is almoſt impoſsible to come there. Halfe our wittes are imployed in this world, to make all things elſe eaſie.

Is there any man here that would be rich with theſe conditions? Let not the rich man tell vs, that hee is not rich. Let him tell God ſoe. Let him not tell mee, that hee keepes it for good purpoſes, this or that, or what it will bee. Let him tell God, and his friend ſo, and deceiue not himſelfe. Euill keeping is almoſt as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as euill getting; and if yee halte with God in your pretences, looke for no better then fire and brimſtrone.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ord it grieued thee (no doubt) to ſee our ſinnefull eſtate; and not ſo much our acts of ſinne, as our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable corrupted will, from whence they came. This drewe thee from thy heauenly throane, to an earthly habitacle, not only to pay our debts, but alſo for our example, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of life. But woe be vnto vs; we endeauour night and day to ſhame thee our louing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter if wee could, by doing, and willing the cleane contrary. By how much the more, I vnworthy wretch of all others am bound to thy greatneſſe; for that yet at length, before all hope be paſt with me, thou haſt giuen mee in part to know my ſelfe. That is to ſay, where I was, and whether thou haſt now led me, and out of what darkneſſe. I ſee it now, thy ſelfe mercifully ſhewing it vnto me. Heretofore I haue not ſeene; my owne will blinding me. Bleſſed Lord, ſince my conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto the, I know my fault, and ſee the cauſe of it. <hi>I haue thought my ſelfe conuerted vnto thee, before I was indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True conuerſion is to turne to thee, and from ſinne, and the ſame ſo to deteſt, as to deſire any thing to ſuffer, then to commit againe. Secondly to haue a watchfull eye ouer our temptations, and euill motions. Thirdly to call to thee effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
<pb facs="tcp:150605:130"/>for grace, and ſtrength. And fourthly in that ſtrength not to doubt, but to reſiſt them manfully as faſt as they come. Wee practiſe commonly the contrary, and giue the bucklers to our enemies, as thinking our ſelues too weake for ſo many aſſaults; and ſo we be without thee. But in thee and in a perfect reſolution to ſerue thee, and to renounce ſinne; my Lord I finde mine enemies euery day weaker, and weaker, not in my owne ſtrength, but thine in me.</p>
               <p>I know thou canſt not abide a coward, or that caſteth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in thy ſeruice; but if our hearty endeauours be with thee, thou ſupplieſt with ſtrength, and neuer ſuffereſt vs to take the foyle. Bleſſed Lord, thou haſt let me ſee now, what hindered my ſight before my conuerſion; euen that which blindeth others, yea, multitudes, that are not yet conuerted vnto thee. That is to ſay, things ſeeming good and faire, that tended to perdition. And beeing no more gracious then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I haue vſed my ſelfe-loue to command, and ſelfe-will to iudge ſo long, that I could not take their maſterie from them without much rebellion; and haue beene therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to thinke thât good or ill, that my humor ſaid was good or ill. And this by ill cuſtome hath made a law in me ſo far forth, that I haue not only thought as they informed me, but alſo I haue verily beleeued whatſoeuer they ſuggeſted.</p>
               <p>Which notwithſtanding, it hath pleaſed thy goodnes, to ſhew me their tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny very palpably. And that firſt in others, whom I haue ſeene in wretched bondage vnto them, and to their owne appetites. Not but that my ſelfe was in the like, or greater; but becauſe we ſpie a fault ſooner in another, then in our ſelues, and they were a glaſſe to ſee my ſelfe in, how monſtrouſly I haue blinded that light of reaſon ere now which thou haſt giuen me, and I had almoſt loſt, and became like a beaſt; vntill thy grace reſtored me, when it was a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to one againſt me.</p>
               <p>My reaſon inſtructeth me, that no creature well ordered is gouerned by it ſelfe. The ſoule much leſſe, among ſo many hidden enemies; ſince in heauen where is no enemy, no ſoule is guided by it ſelfe. My reaſon telleth me, that none is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown but by ſelf-rule. And we confeſſe it in reater crimes,
<pb facs="tcp:150605:130"/>wilfull murther, inceſts, robbery, &amp; the like; becauſe they be more notably puniſhed in ſight. In leſſe we cannot ſee it ſo well, becauſe they are more qualified &amp; mingled by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, &amp; il cuſtome, that they may poiſon the more cunningly.</p>
               <p>My reaſon, &amp; experience teach me, that the deuill hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to work vpon, but our will, &amp; is a moſt ſubtill perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And therfore if I haue no more wil, or wit, but my own, it is impoſsible to ſtand againſt him. And very likely it is I am not as I ſhould be, when I do nothing all the day long, but my own wil, nor am angry or melancholie at any thing, but my own will croſſed ſome way or other; which perhaps was thy ſending, and then I ſhould be glad.</p>
               <p>My reaſon inſtructed with reading, and hearing, hath taught me, that I cannot haue heauen heere, and in the world to come. And yet my ſhunning at griefs, and croſſes, and againe my labouring, and laying for temporall emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tell me to my face, that I haue ſought nothing but my heauen heere, howſoeuer I haue looked vpward in my prayers towards thee for a faſhion.</p>
               <p>My reaſon, and grace, how little ſoeuer it be, dareth not deny but thou art truth. And thou haſt ſaid, <hi>The way to heauen is narrow, and fewe doe finde it.</hi> And yet my life and actions doe make it ſeeme broade.
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.14.</note> Rather I am to ſuſpect that I am out of the way, by the broadneſſe of it: and am in my reaſon to doubt, and aske, that I may be ſet in my right way, and not to reſt vntill I be in it. And it is hard to finde. Firſt, becauſe I neuer went it. Secondly, becauſe I vſe not to aske it. I aske not, becauſe commonly I thinke not of it, hauing found by the way goodly meddowes, and fine earthly things, or at the leaſt the deſires of them; that haue holden me diſtracted, and buſied one way or other, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I want day almoſt to goe any further.</p>
               <p>Moreouer I cannot but liſten, and beleeue them, that haue trodden this path before me. The practiſe and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of thy knowne Saints, that (being ſometimes as I was when I doubted ſo little of my ſelfe, and as euery one is at this houre, that is not yet conuerted) confeſſe how malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, they were ouer borne by their own will, euen to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
<pb facs="tcp:150605:131"/>and yet ſaw it not, no more then I did then; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their owne likings as I did then; thought they did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough as I thought then, counted others ouer ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as I did then, if they had much care of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and all this thy Saints haue found as ſoone as they caſt off the yoake of their owne wils, and had giuen their names to thy holy ſeruice.</p>
               <p>From which time being afterward thy ſpeciall ſeruants, and I hearing, and reading their true opinions, what they thought of themſelues, when they were as I was, and thought my ſelfe ſo ſure: good God, what reaſon had I to thinke my ſelfe ſafe, and not rather to aske the way of ſome skilfull body, and forſweare this cloſeneſſe to my ſelfe as long as I liued. Thy noble Doctor Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, that when I thought or perſwaded my ſelfe that I went forward daily vnder the ſailes of my own will, I went iuſt backward. For ſo ſaith this Doctor hee did, and yet thought verily that he went forward.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I truſted (ſaith hee) ſometimes in my owne power,
<note place="margin">Mcd.</note> and when I meant ſo to runne, where I thought I ſhould ſtand moſt, euen there I fell moſt, and was caſt behind hand, and not forward; and that which I thought verily to catch, went further and further from me. But now I know thou haſt illuminated mee. Becauſe what I thought I could moſt, that could I alwaies leaſt of my ſelfe. I had a will, but I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ability; I had ability, but I wanted will; becauſe I truſted in my owne ſtrength. But now I confeſſe vnto thee my Lord God, father of heauen and earth, that a man ſhall not growe ſtrong in his owne ſtrength; nor fooliſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of any fleſh vaunt it ſelfe before thee. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, he ſaith: I thought I was ſomewhat, and I was nothing; I ſaid I would become wiſe, and I became a foole; I thought I was wiſe, and I was deceiued.</q> Thus farre and much more to that effect hath this Doctor.</p>
               <p>How much more then may wê ſay it, that liue abroade, and haue to doe with the world? where euery thing diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth vs from thee, euery toy dulleth vs, delights darken, cares oppreſſe, and much buſines confoundes our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb facs="tcp:150605:131"/>and diſableth it wholly of it ſelfe, to iudge what is beſt for vs without a Doctor.</p>
               <p>And yet I cannot deny (my Lord) but true it is that ſhamefully and blaſphemouſly we beare our ſelues in hand that we are ruled by thee, when yet wee haue nothing elſe in vs but a bundle of concupiſcences, and deſires, that tend not to thee, but daily pull from thee. As couetouſnes, and pride, vncleane life, and ribauldry, hatred, and emulation, brawling, ſwearing, drunkenneſſe, and epicuriſme, and ſome worſe then theſe; which the dooers of them do daily father vpon thy bleſſed will. Not by ſaying that thoſe acts be thy will; but by ſaying, or thinking they doe thy will daily, when yet theſe bad fruites, and none but theſe growe vpon them more, and more, with little or no amending at all. Whom when I ſee notwithſtanding to be holden wiſe, yea in all ages ſome ſuch graced in the world for their naturall gifts, and fortune, which thou haſt beſtowed vpon them; what a mirrour is this, that thou haſt giuen mee to ſee my ſelfe by, as I ſaid in the beginning, and to fly ſelfe-gouerning as a mortall enemy.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, from my cradle in a manner thou haſt taught mee how corrupt our nature is, how proane to euill, and apt to follow our ſelues, and our owne wayes. And hereupon we wiſh when we be young, that we were growne to be men; hoping then, that we ſhall rule our ſelues, and doe what we liſt. And when we haue our wiſh, and the bridle in our own hands, what haue we gotten? euen that which in our child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and weake iudgement, and before we had fully the vſe of reaſon, we deſired, and thought a very good thing; euen that our corrupt nature loueth, and imbraceth moſt, to rule our ſelues. Which my vnderſtanding then muſt needes conclude. If ſo deſired of children, of corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of thoſe that bee moſt weake, and imperfect; <hi>ergo</hi> childiſh; <hi>ergo</hi> an imperfect thing, and tending to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of body in bodily things, and of ſoule in ſoule buſines. Againe, if ſo deſired in childhood, and corrupt nature, <hi>ergo</hi> to be reſiſted and ſubdued in mans eſtate, and reaſonable nature, as well as other childrens toyes, that we bluſh to vſe
<pb facs="tcp:150605:132"/>when we be men.</p>
               <p>Which when I haue done the contrary; that is to ſay, maintained it and nouriſh't it in me, by ſeeking, and plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my deſires, though not in childiſh things, as children vſe to doe, yet in other things anſwerable to my yeares, and eſtate, and haue ſhunned alwaies to be ruled or heare coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to the contrary: I had iuſt cauſe therefore in my light of reaſon, to miſdeeme and ſuſpect my actions, both to be childiſh in the reſpect of the originall of them; and alſo wicked in reſpect of the diſcretion and other abilities, which thou gaueſt me to diſcerne it withall.</p>
               <p>But now my Lord God, and king of eternall Maieſtie, I know thou haſt illuminated me (as thy ſeruant Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith) becauſe I ſee, I can doe nothing of my ſelfe; which either I ſaw not before, or would not ſee. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no ſinner can at all times perfectly aſſure himſelfe of thy fauour whileſt hee liueth: yet ſome comforts or <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens</hi> as it were <hi>earneſt-pennies,</hi> it pleaſeth thee to beſtowe vpon vs, whereby with humility wee may beleeue and bee perſwaded that wee bee in thy fauour, and aſſuredly hope, that we be conuerted vnto thee. And that by nothing more then by the alteration of our wils, and deſires, which wee feele, and finde by thy grace, ouer that wee did before our conuerſion. And hee that hath not this feeling, and hath beene a ſinner, can hardly thinke himſelfe truely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, no more then a ſicke body can recouer, but he muſt feele it, and can tell when he began to amend. And by this feeling and alteration that I finde in me, I hope I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto thee, and haue ioy, and comfort in it; not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming in my owne merit, but humbling my ſelfe in thy greatneſſe, that haſt made mee partaker of ſo great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite.</p>
               <p>And to thy onely glory, and my poore comfort, I often call to mind how it is with me now, and how heeretofore when I was all alike without alteration, and felt my ſelfe neither better nor worſe at any time. And although ſelfe-loue in me hath made me been careleſſe, as yeſterday, and the day before, ſo this day, and the ſame this yeare, that
<pb facs="tcp:150605:132"/>I was the yeare before, and many yeares before that, without finding any difference at all in mee, but that if I were well now, I was well then; if well then alſo now; and at this ſtay I kept many yeares together at an euen water, but indeede ebbing; and marked not that none can ſtand at a ſtay in thy ſeruice, but <hi>qui non proficit, deficit;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leo.</note> and that ſhall euery one feele in themſelues, if they flatter not themſelues. All this while I ſay, I could not think my ſelfe truely conuerted vnto thee; becauſe I could not remeber, or make eſtimate, when I began to alter from my wonted deſires, or ſinnefull eſtate.</p>
               <p>I began not my conuerſion with hearing of ſermons one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and little care to follow them; or with reading good bookes, and liking or commending them onely, which was but for a faſhion. I began not with outward receiuing the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which we were wont to doe at a certen age, and are worſe and worſe for it, if wee take not heede. I began not with inward ſecurity that all was well with me, becauſe I felt no reſiſtance in me. For this was indeede no true ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but a blindneſſe, and puniſhment for ſinne, bredde by cuſtome; like thoſe that liue in an ill ayre, and care not to goe out of it, becauſe they are vſed to it.</p>
               <p>All theſe were to me no arguments of my conuerſion. But contrariwiſe, that I was all this while in the cloudes, and darkeneſſe of ſelfe-conceit, and ſelfe-liking. It was my very great fault, and I confeſſe vnexcuſeable; that beeing ſo well indued by thee, as I was, and ſo quicke of ſight otherwiſe; I would be ſo groſſely miſledde by my enemy where he liſted; vntill it pleaſed thee of thy infinite goodneſſe to pull in my ſcattered thoughts, and madeſt me ſee his deceits that blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me; gaueſt mee a heart to bee pennitent and ſorowfull, grace to bee thankfull, care to be watchfull, and courage to feare no blowes that I might receiue from any aduerſity or proſperity in time to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hoc ſignum poſuiſti in nubibus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> This is the firſt ſigne or mark which thou did'ſt put in the clouds of my ſoule. Euer ſince I haue had a deteſtation of ſinne more or leſſe, and a deſire to know my ſinne. Since that time alſo I haue beene afraide to truſt my owne iudgement againe in matters of my ſoule.
<pb facs="tcp:150605:133"/>Mee thinke I heard thee ſay to mee:

                  <hi>fili, ſine conſilio nihil fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias;</hi> and, <hi>peccator homc vitabit correptionem,</hi> I know right well that cuſtome in ſinne maketh vs thinke wee ſinne not, when we ſinne. And therefore I haue doubted my ſelfe, and asked ſuch as haue thy ſpirit, and know more in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>After this it hath pleaſed thee ſecondly to nouriſh my poore endeauours with gladneſſe, much like to them that are lightened of a heauy burthen.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when of frailty I haue fallen againe at any time; thy mercy towards mee hath not giuen mee ouer, but hath touched me inwardly with ſome heauines, and anger againſt my ſelfe, till by thy ordinary meanes I haue beene reſtored againe to good eſtate.</p>
               <p>More then this, thou haſt giuen me a fourth <hi>token,</hi> which is to examine my thoughts, wordes, and deedes many times in a we eke. Eſpecially in thoſe things I vſe to offend in moſt; that by often contrition, and ſorrow for them, I may be the readier for thee, and not altogether vnprouided if thou ſhouldeſt call me any time vpon the ſuddaine. For all which good <hi>ſignes,</hi> and <hi>loue-tokens</hi> of thy thine, I humbly thanke thee, and beſeech thee to continue to my liues ende. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>THE SECOND HOMAGE OF A SOVLE PROCEEDING IN GODS GRACE, with ſignes thereof.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> My Lord God, by thy gifts we are il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated, &amp; carried vpward; by thy light and leading we goe higher and higher, &amp; make aſcents in our hearts, and ſing vnto thee a <hi>canticle of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi> or <hi>ſong of parts.</hi> Behold the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or ſteps thou haſt made in my ſoule. O that thou couldeſt beholde them in me, as thy gracious goodnes hath intended them to my vndeſeruing ſelfe. Thou haſt ſhewed me much, and I haue followed little. Thou haſt inſpired often, and I haue imbraced ſeldome. Thou haſt proffered great things, and I haue not bin anſwerable. Thou haſt often dropped on my marble heart, that it might be made hollow and capeable of thy hony dew, at the leaſt wiſe in ſome ſmall meaſure, and quantity.</p>
               <p>Small, and very ſmall it is indeed by my owne fault, as thou doſt know, and my ſelfe bewaile; yet ſomewhat it is, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is. In reſpect whereof I am to reioyce in it, being thy gift, and therefore good, although in leſſe meaſure then thou haſt meant it me, yet more a great deale without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then I could euer deſerue. I reioyce, and praiſe thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt done great things vpon mee. All creatures praiſe thee in their creation, for which they be <hi>Homagers</hi> to thee of duty, and <hi>Tributaries</hi> of endleſſe thankes. Men much more, and I aboue all, do praiſe thee, or ought to praiſe thee,
<pb facs="tcp:150605:134"/>and I much more then numbers, doe owe vnto thee all that can be due by a ſubiect to his Prince, by a child to his parent, by a loſt childe, or caſt-away to a pittifull father, by a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, or gally-ſlaue to a mercifull redeemer, by a ruefull and vnhappie firebrand of hell, to a moſt ſweete, and bountifull Sauiour. Euen whatſoeuer a creature can posſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly owe vnto his Creator, all that I doe owe vnto thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould reckon the things that haue made me indebted to thy greatneſſe, it would aske an infinite labour. For thy benefits haue no end, nor am I able to expreſſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the leaſt of them. Howbeit for ſo much as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of benefits receiued, is both a thankfullneſſe to a benefactour, and a ſtirrer of duty, and deuotion in the receiuer; I cannot but often remember to thy glory, and my poore comfort, how I haue beene loſt, and how thou haſt found me; being found, I was ſlacke, and thou diddeſt put me forward; vſing firſt my ſelfe-loue to pricke mee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with feare of eternall damnation; and after a while v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my feare to fly ſinne, and to ſeeke thee; by ſeeking thee to know thee, and by knowing thee to bee acquainted with thee in ſome ſort; by acquaintance with thee to fall in loue with thee; and with loue of thee to contemne all but thee; firſt a litle, then more; euen according to my grace with thee, and my poore endeauours.</p>
               <p>And theſe bee the <hi>degrees,</hi> or <hi>ſtaires</hi> that a good will hath made in my ſoule. Feare firſt draue mee till I came at loue; and when loue had the maſtery, it draue away feare. Feare frighted me for doing ſinne; thy loue vrged me to loathing of ſinne. For who ſeeth thee, and knoweth thee, that art tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brightneſſe, and deteſteth not ſinne, that is true deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fowleneſſe, and diſhonour? Happy the feare that feareth to offend thee, but how much happier the loue that deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in pleaſing thee? for both I humbly thank thee, and for continuing in both, I thanke thee more. Many haue both for a time, and are at loſſe againe at an other time; riſing and falling with the tide of their paſsions, and faring like thoſe that hazzard all vpon the vncertaine dice, and haue mony in
<pb facs="tcp:150605:134"/>their purſes at one time, and none at an other.</p>
               <p>With mee likewiſe it hath beene ſo ere now. But now I hope in thy grace not ſo. Yea, though my frailties, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imperfections doe daily humble me in my owne eyes; yet thy grace makes mee bold to ſay, that thy feare, and loue hath now gotten ſome ſtrength, and taken roote in me. The which thou haſt ſhewne vnto mee, as to other thy ſeruants, by ſome <hi>ſignes,</hi> and <hi>tokens,</hi> that thou giueſt vs, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vs the more in thy ſeruice. And theſe are daily amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or care of amendment, and all thoſe graces, &amp; ſtrength, that follow thereof. Which are ioy and quiet of mind in thy ſeruice; obeying thee without repining, loſſe without grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hauing chaſte thoughts without corruption, patience without murmuring, humility without affecting, feare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple or diſpaire, truth without doubleneſſe, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>But in particular I haue noted theſe things following, which I account not onely <hi>ſignes,</hi> but alſo exceeding great benefits of thine. And which it behooueth euery ſoule that hath them, as well to be mindfull of, to be thankfull; as of his ſinnes, to be penitent; and ſorrowfull for them.</p>
               <p>The firſt and greateſt is, a great good liking I haue to be rather ſubiect, and vnder in a meane ſort, if it pleaſed thee ſo, then to be ouer others in the beſt ſort that can be in the world. Knowing well my owne exceeding weakenes, and inſufficiencie to gouerne others, that haue ſpoyled my ſelfe well-neere with gouerning but one: and alſo ſeeing that gouernment hath alwayes multiplicity of buſines,
<note place="margin">Eccli. 28.</note> &amp; buſines cannot be without many neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, which (vnles thy grace be maruellous great) doe turne thy face from vs daily more and more, and put vs quite from our by as to heauen-ward.</p>
               <p>An other benefite it hath pleaſed thee to beſtow on mee, which is a deſire, and loue I haue to bee alwaies reading, or hearing talke of thee, either in ſermons, or otherwiſe, if my ſpare time and vocation doe permit me; which if it doe not, it contents me yet to thinke of thee often. And this thy benefite hath in mee alſo two more with it, which I ſhould not miſſe for any thing.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:150605:135"/>
               <p> The firſt is, that I regard not the ſtile, or eloquence of one, or other, but the ſence, and ſpirit of the writer, or preacher; thinking it euer an argument of great imperfection in me, to heare him for the ſtile, or tongue, and to bee left to nouices rather, that know not yet what thy ſeruice meaneth; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Jndians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> that are drawne to know thee firſt with trifling things, as rings, bels, &amp; looking-glaſſes, that pleaſed them, and made them firſt to loue thy ſeruants, and by little and little to liſten to them, and afterward to beleeue them, and to acknowledge thy truth. Neither doe thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and preachers (though greatly, and diuerſly indued by thee with nature, and art) vſe to affect eloquence in their preaching. Or if they doe, it is but toſerue our vicious, and curious eares, that will not be drawne to thee without many words, and deuices, and much perſwaſion. All meſſengers are alike to me, that come with tydings from thee: let them ſtut or ſpeake plaine, all is one to mee, ſo they tell mee true. My loue doth eaſily ſupply all defects that may be.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that when I heare a vertue commended, I thinke not ſtreight, that I come neere the perfection of it. Or when I heare a vice, or notorious ſinne inueighed againſt; thy mercy is ſuch towards me, that I thinke not ſtreight of ſuch, or ſuch a one to be touched, but onely my ſelfe, either in act, or will, if thy grace had not letted me; or elſe I am mooued therby to compunction for my former life paſt, or for others in generall, that are yet intangled in the ſame ſinne.</p>
               <p>It is alſo another great benefit of thine, that of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thou putteſt me often in mind of my owne weaknes for perſeuerance, or conſtancy in reſiſting ſinne, or temptation, as of my ſelfe, but only by thee. And to that end I often pray to thee ſtill for more grace, and further ſupply of thy gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes towards me. And in receiuing any grace of thee, I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies humbled by it in reſpect of thy free bounty &amp; liberality and my owne vnworthines, that can no waies deſerue it.</p>
               <p>O my Sauidur I cannot think of theſe thy benefits ſo great, without bluſhing; that euer thou ſhouldeſt beſtow them ſo freely vpon ſo poore a worme of the earth, &amp; ſo vngratefull a creature, as I haue beene, and am. And yet not heere an end
<pb facs="tcp:150605:135"/>of thy benefits. Which the further I wade into, the further (me thinke) I am from an end. Yet two or three more (with thy leaue) I can not but ſpeake of, becauſe they are comforts alſo, and <hi>tokens</hi> to me, that I am in thy grace. Grant I beſeech thee, that I may be thankefull.</p>
               <p>I hâue beene ſoon angry ere now, and long in pleaſing. And that either through ſtrength of my paſsion, and little heede how thou frownedſt vpon me all the while; or els for that I thought it vnworthy of a high mind to be ſoone pleaſed with out much mediation firſt. And ſo (as the deuil would haue it) I haue made two or three ſinnes of one. But now through thy grace moſt chiefely, and my owne endeauour, and watch (which is alſo thy grace) I haue in a manner killed the heart of this infirmity; and doe prepare my ſelfe againſt it at the firſt encounter, when occaſion is. If I happen to be diſgraced, diſdained, or flouted, none of theſe (I thanke thee) diſturbe me within; or if they doe, thy grace is with me by and by, to amend my ſelfe by it in ſomewhat, or to pitty them that wrong me without cauſe, or thinke it ſent me for my tryall, or mortification.</p>
               <p>I find that the Philoſophers had theſe vertues alſo; but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it was for pride much-what, &amp; praiſe of men. And they thought it a high degree of vertue, if they had done a fault to goe into the market place, and publiſh it there, and to lay themſelues open to euery mans reprehenſion. But this to do, as it may be ſcandalous, ſo I ſee it not practiſed by any of thy ſeruants. And yet if it be done, <hi>magiſtro, et fratri,</hi> (as S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> ſaith) I holde it not good to conceale any thing eyther done, or intended. I ſeeke not praiſe of men, but ſimply to pleaſe thee. And I can take a reprehenſion in good part, though told me in the worſt manner.</p>
               <p>The Philoſophers haue another opinion, that hee that profites in vertue, ſhall neuer dreame they doe ill, no more then a beaſt (they ſay) will goe out of the way he is vſed to, although he be turned looſe, and the reines on his necke. But this I know by thy grace is no certaine <hi>ſigne.</hi> For the enemy when he cannot faſten on vs waking, will delude vs ſleeping, yea and make vs beleeue we ſinned when wee did not, if wee
<pb facs="tcp:150605:136"/>gaue no prouocation to it waking, which we muſt labour to auoide.</p>
               <p>In all my contracts, bargaines, &amp; promiſes, I am very ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous of my words, that they prooue true. And I vſe to aske much counſell, if there be any likelihood of iniuſtice. I thanke thy goodnes for it; I haue as much care of this, as I haue of the title I deale withall; eſpecially towards my inferiours.</p>
               <p>One common infirmity I am carefull to preuent. And that is ingratitude, a churliſh and vnmannerly ſinne; that raignes both in court and countrey. I had rather lye faſt for debt, then be ingrate. It is worth a mans ſtudy to ſatisfie where one is beholding; and rather to my inferiours, and equals, then to my betters, though neceſſary to both.</p>
               <p>One miſerable gulfe I haue eſcaped by thy grace, which I beſeech thee of thy goodneſſe to continue to my liues ende. And that is <hi>aptneſſe to take ſcandall.</hi> Hee is halfe way in hell, that will be ſoone ſcandalized. All the world is full of <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</hi> It is called <hi>ſcandalum puſillorum,</hi> Scandall of the weake. If I ſee a Saint do naught, yet by thy grace I will not do naught; but looke to my ſelfe the better for it. No abuſe of religion ſhall weaken my faith. The thing abuſed I like neuer the worſe for the abuſe, but the better. Being the diuels doing, to raiſe ſcandall on that which is good, to take that which is good away. If Church-men excommunicate for money, and abſolue for money, and take more of a rich man, then of a poore; is the Church of leſſe authority for their abuſe? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thinke with my ſelfe, what corruption can ſcandalize me. And this is thy grace, with many others daily growing on me. And which thou knoweſt I ſpeak not to my praiſe, but to thine, that art the giuer. Thou giueſt both <hi>velle, &amp; perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi> I endeauour, though but weakely ſometimes; performe it thou, for thy mercies ſake, and and make me ſtill ſtronger and ſtronger. <hi>Amen.</hi>
